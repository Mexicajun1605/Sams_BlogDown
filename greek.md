# 10 reasons to learn Greek 
Γεια σας φιλοι μου! Today, I will be writing about why you should learn Greek. 

1. The New Testament was written in Greek 

Hindus learn Sanskrit, Muslims learn Greek, and Jews learn Hebrew. These are the sacred languages of their religions. But why don't Christians learn Greek? The entirety of the New Testament was written in this language, including the words of God Himself, in the form of His son Jesus Christ. Shouldn't this be a good enough reason on its own. 
If you are serious about Christianity, or interested in it, you should seriously take a look at learning some Greek. 

2. Everything human that can be said has been said in Greek 

Not only does Greek contain the words of God, but it also is the language with which we understand logic and philosophy, both Greek words. Everythig beautiful that can be said about the world has already been said in the Septuagint, Sapho, Plato, Alexia Komnena, the Church Fathers, Homer, Hesiod, the Evangelists and more. The sheer amount of "knowing of the human soul" contained within the realm of Greek is surely greater than any other language. 
From the Buddhist sutras of the Greco-Bactrian kingdoms to the love between Daphne and Chloe, all human experiences of joy, sorrow, and emotion are found in the corpus of Greek literature alongside the tools of how to process those emotions.  

3. The Greek mind thinks differently 

While this is true of every language, I think that Greek is particularly therapeutic for the Western person. 
It is often said that Greece was the birthplace of the West, however, after converting to Orthodoxy, I am convinced that would be Rome. Greece appears to be more eastern to me while maintaining a level of Aristotelianism classic to the West. In other words, just like its geographic location, Greek culture is neither eastern nor wester, rather it combines the best of both. This can be seen from the range of ruins the Greeks have left from Portugal to India, with everywhere in between influenced by them. 

In other words, the Greek language will help in understanding the Greek mind, which is at the center of both the East and the West, giving insight into both.

4. Greek is both ancient and modern 

The differences between Koine (the variety of ancient Greek the NT is written in) and Modern Greek tend to be exaggerated. Knowing one will certainly enhance intelligibility in the other. While certainly more different than British and American English, I would hesitate to call these different languages. In fact, educated speakers of Modern Greek can understand the scriptures without assistance when attending liturgy. 
Learning Greek provides access to both the ancient and the modern worlds. It is crucial to have one foot in each of these, especially nowadays. 

5. It will teach you who you are 

Above the doors of the temple of the Oracle at Delphi hung a plaque that said "Know thyself." And as surely as the gods demanded such a thing of the Greeks, so too does their language demand of us. For example, 
- Is the love you have for someone φιλος, ερος, or αγαπη?
- Is the honor you show something or someone τημη, προσευχη, or λατρεια?
- Is the happiness you feel ευχαριστομενη, ευδαιμονια, or χαρα?

Greek can help you distinguish between these concepts that the modern mind has confused. For example, the modern man both loves his wife and ice cream. Nonetheless, these words are distinct in Greek, αρεσει vs αγαπω. 

6. Reorient your standards 

Modern man has no standards and nothing to live for; Greek helps remedy this. The Greeks viewed everything as having a τελος, that is an endpoint or destination/utility for something. For example, the τελος of a pen is to be used for writing. 
Once we understand this concept, it is natural to ask ourselves, what our own τελος may be and to try and live in accordance with this ideal. Going back to the idea of East and West, you may be reminded of the Dharma when thinking of this. 
This idea is so rooted in the Greek mind that something reaching its τελος is considered perfect, as can be seen in the translation of perfect, τελικα. 
This can also aleviate some pressure when Christ tells us to be perfect. 

7. There's no pressure to get things right 

Even though the Greek mind will push you towards your τελος, there is no pressure to get things right in Greek. The Greek speakers that I have met, have all been encouraging and delighted that I would attempt to learn their language. 
Speaking to a man in his native language is like speaking to him in his heart, says Charlemagne. The Greeks know this. 
If you study Ancient or Koine Greek, the pressure is even less because nobody speaks like that anymore, so if you make a mistake, no worries. 

8. You can visit Greece 

Unlike with Latin or Sanskrit, there is actually a place with around 11 million people who speak Greek. And it is a beautiful one with everything a person could want ranging from beautiful beaches to ancient ruins to ski resorts. Greece has something for everyone. 
While I could go on forever in this section, just look up tourist destinations in Greece and that should be a good motivation. 

9. Academic equivalent of superpowers 

While any list of reasons to learn Greek will include the etymology of things, I would like to take it a step further. Honestly, knowing that telephone is Greek does not help most people out in their daily lives, however, for students knowing Greek can be a superpower in the sciences and humanities. For example, a biology student who knows Greek could remember dinosaur names easier, i.e. triceratops = three horns, tyrannosaurus = tyrant lizard, pterodactyl = wing fingers. 

10. Knowing Greek is a mark of Education and Culture 

About one hundred years ago, any intelligent person in the Western world was expected to know either Greek or Latin or both. Learning Greek puts you in the club of intelligent gentlemen like Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson, Christopher Lee, and J.R.R. Tolkien. Who doesn't want to be included in a list like that?
