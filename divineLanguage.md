# Finding the diving in language

## Language as the vehicle for a Cosmovision

Ancient and Medieval people lived a life that was very different from ours as modern people. Everything was alive and there is no such thing as a non-animist worldview prior to the industrial revolution. Consider the Gargoyles on Catholic Cathedrals, Aesop's fables with humanized animals, and more. Because of this, it is not absurd that we find God within the fabric of the languages we speak. He was literally everything to our ancestors and we can see it in our linguistic heritage. 

Because of this, the language, that people in the past have passed on to us, is filled with magic and divinity, both lexically and morphologically. 
## Theolinguistics

Renowned linguist David Crystal cites Crystal(2008) in his article on Theolinguistics(2018) that the term can be defined as "the study of the relationship between language and religious thought."

Despite the apparent lack of recognition of this study as a genuine subclass of linguistics, alongside Historical, Psycho, and socio-linguistics, this is without a doubt a genuine field of study that requires more investigation, both for the insights that it can provide to the field of linguistics and to the field of theology. 

Furthermore, while hard linguistic determinism is definitely not at play, the interchange between language and culture is undeniable, leading to the inevitable conclusion that theological implications in the structure of language can teach us a lot about the cultures that speak those languages and their perception of the divine. 

## Latin and the Romance languages

### Interjections and the obvious

In this article, I will be using Latin and the Romance languages as my primary example of how the Divine can be found in language. 

First, let us address the elephant in the room, interjections and expressions. Everywhere in the Romance speaking world, we can hear expressions such as "Nossa Senhora" in Portuguese, "Dios mio" in Spanish, "Mon Dieu" in French, etc. These aformentioned expressions are explicitly used in situations where something unfortunate or surprising has happened. For example, when a Portuguese speaker has difficulty believing something he invokes Mother Mary by saying "Nossa Senhora." While the intention of the speaker in the modern world may be divorced from faith, it is undoubtedly derived from an invocation or prayer to the Divine Mother. Poggi (2009) classifies these types of interjections as ejaculative interjections, using the following Italian phrases, Ges√π, Madonna, mamma, Maria, misericordia. 

We clearly can establish a universality of invocations to the Christian God and Saints based upon the previous examples. 

However, the gods of Rome have not left the minds and language of Romance speakers today. For example, the days of the week and some months continue to be governed by Janus (enero, janeiro, janvier), Mercury (miercoles, mercredi), Mars (martes, mardi), etc. I do not feel the need to cite this since it is considered common knowledge in linguistics spheres. Nonetheless, I want to draw attention to it, because once more, we are finding the Divine in everyday occurrences. 

### Morphology and Etymology

Beyond just the obvious, the grammar and the etymology of Romance languages show the conception of their speakers' theology. For example, students of Romance languages and Latin will be accustomed to noticing a root to the words that they use in addition to a grammatical suffix. However, upon observation, we can find that there are indeed semantic suff/pre/infixes in Latin that have carried on to the Romance languages. 

Indeed, some of these beliefs go back to Indo-European. Mallory (1989) cites the etymology of Latin "credere" as deriving from the Indo-European "Krh-" meaning heart and "dhe-" meaning place. In other words, our ancestor believed that believing in something meant placing your heart in it.  

Another one of these morphemes that I find very intriguing is the "am-" root. This root appears to mean all that has to do with with love and good will. For example, we receive from this word the Latin "amicus", "amor", "amar", "amans", "amicitia", and "amoenus". All of these words have equivalents in the modern languages, E.G. Spanish amigo, amor, amar, amante, amistad, ameno. 

The connection between friendship and love is particularly striking for me. In the modern west, we have separated the idea of love and friendship into different things. However, it appears clear, that somewhere, our ancestors believed that a friend was someone that you had love for. 

Furthermore, we can observe how the way love was enacted and perceived in those times differs from our perception in the modern West. Sadly, we have taken love to mean something that is McDonaldized, i.e. Divorce rates, loneliness among friendless men, etc. To love someone or something is to be diligent to that thing. The Latin "Diligo" gives us the modern Spanish "diligente", French "diligent", and indeed the English equivalent of diligent. Nonetheless, St. Jerome's translation of the Bible uses this word for an active form of love as below. Note that "dilexit" is merely a conjugation of "diligo". 

1 John 4:11
Vulgate
Carissimi, si sic Deus **dilexit** nos: et nos debemus alterutrum **diligere**.
King James
Beloved, if God so **loved** us, we ought also to **love** one another.

This is not some random use of the word. The root "dilig" appears in the Vulgate 289 times. This does not include various conjugations of the word either, such as "dilexit". Click [here](https://www.biblegateway.com/quicksearch/?quicksearch=dilig&version=VULGATE) for the results of this root on BibleGateWay.com if you are interested. 

From this observation of the word, we can observe that our ancestors believed that to love someone was an active act on the part of the one loving. We cannot passively feel love, but rather live in it as we are diligent about other things in our life. 


## Conclusion and where to go from here 

In Romance, the Divine and our everyday life can not be separated in a linguistic environment, as evidenced by the modern Languages. The same holds true for English. Take note of it as you speak in your everyday life. You will constantly be invoking various Spirits and God Himself constantly. 

I hope that you can take something away from this. 
God bless you and Pax Domini tecum sit.
