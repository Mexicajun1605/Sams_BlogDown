Hola, Bonjour, Wie gehts, Tudo bem, annyeong, et Salve, 

My name is Sam and I am a lifelong learner. As a linguist, instructor, and analyst/researcher. Professionally my passions include researching linguistics, teaching languages, with experience in French, Portuguese, and Spanish, analyzing data to find patterns and insights to learn and teach new things, qualitative research, and I also do some Web development as well. 

Some of the tools that I am passionate about are the R, Python, and Ruby programming languages. Some examples of my work in these languages can be found on this site. I hope that you enjoy them. 

The languages that I speak in order of proficiency are English, Native, Spanish, in which I have an M.A, French, with teaching experience, Portuguese, Latin, German, and I know pieces or facts of other languages such as Persian, Korean, Japanese, Greek, Russian, Yucatec Mayan, and Sanskrit. 

I am currently looking for work in tech or education, or both while I adjunct as a Portuguese instructor at New Mexico state and work as a Head Lifeguard for the Parks and Recreation department of Las Cruces, NM. 

Outside of the realms of study and work, I like to spend my time hiking, making and maintaining terrariums, photography, playing video games, usually in another language, and spending time with my wife and cat.
