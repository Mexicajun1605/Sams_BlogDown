## About me

I am a linguist with strong abilities in Data. My strengths include autodidacticism, communication, and simplification of complex ideas. 
I want to use my abilities in Data, particularly with Natural Language Processing, to make the world a better place. I thrive while working
independently and am flexible in complex situations. Furthermore, I am an educator of Spanish, French, Romance Languages, and Linguistics.
Currently I am looking to use these skills in educational environments.
