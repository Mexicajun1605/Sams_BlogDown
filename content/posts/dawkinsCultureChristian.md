# Richard Dawkins is not a cultural Christian 

Recently, Richard Dawkins and Jordan Peterson had an interview in which they discussed various topics involving God. Dawkins has made the claim however, that he is a cultural Christian, despite not believing in God. I believe that this interview shows that Dawkins is not in fact a cultural Christian based on the following. 

1. Knowing Christian things does not make you Christian
2. Misunderstanding of Faith based Epistemics 
3. Strict Materialism 

## 1. Knowing Christian things does not make you Christian 
"What I meant by that is no more than that I was brought up in a Christian culture. I went to Christian schools, so I know my way around the Bible. I know my way around the Book of Common Prayer. I know the hymns. Um, that's all. I don’t value Christianity as a truth." - Richard Dawkins  

To Richard Dawkins Truth is uniquely restricted to Science based claims. In a previous post, I remarked that Truth is more than facts and this is most certainly a case that Dawkins does not understand. 

However, in the above quote where he describes his "Cultural Christianity," Dawkins is distilling a worldview and faith system into a set of mere practices and facts. To Dawkins the Materialist presence of churches, hymns, and Bibles, is sufficient to create what he perceives to be a Christian culture. 

This contrasts with reality, in fact even recent reality. Throughout the last century, many Christians in the Soviet Union were prohibited from having public spaces of worship, singing hymns, and from having scripture. Nonetheless, it would appear to be foolish to say that they did not practice Christianity in any way whatsoever. They may have in fact only participated in such things a handful of times in life. 

A more modern and closer to home contrast are the Trump worshipping blasphemers. Would it be or is it apt to call the person who commits violence in the name of a false prophet a cultural Christian merely on the basis of familiarity with the Bible, hymns, and having attended a "Christian" school? Of course not. 

The praxis of Christianity involves more than just the mere indicators of the faith, but also deeply invokes and cooperates with the prototypes behind such icons. To ignore this, is to ignore the Truth of what it means to act like a Christian. 

## 2. Misunderstanding of Faith based Epistemics 

"Okay, let's grant the faint praise, but that has nothing to do with the truth value. What I care about is the truth value. I see no truth value in the claims of Christianity: the Virgin Birth, the Resurrection, the miracles." - Richard Dawkins

Epistemology is the philosophy around how we know what is true and what is not true. Christian epistemology fundamentally differs from that of Secular Epistemology. 
To narrow this down using Scientific terms, Secular Epistemology relies on 3 forms of knowledge. 
1. Deduction (discovering Truth through syllogism) 
I.e. Socrates is a man. All men are mortal. Socrates is mortal. 
2. Induction (Extraction of Truth through repeated phenomenon) 
I.e. The sun will rise in the morning because it always does 
3. Abduction (Innate knowledge) 
I.e. Breathing, eating, walking, etc. 

Most materialists and scientific worldviews are restricted to only these forms of knowing things. However, when we delve into ancient literature it becomes apparent that there is indeed, a fourth type of knowledge. 

4. Revelation (Reception of Truth/Information from unseen sources)
I.e. The Prayer rule to the Theotokos to St. Seraphim of Sarov. 

What makes the fourth epistemic different from the first three is that it relies on an external source for the derivation of Truth. In other words, despite the fact that the Prayer Rule of the Theotokos is attributed to St. Seraphim, by his own admission, it was a revelation to him from a divine source. The knowledge came from somewhere else. Revelation does not necessarily have to be divine either. For example, the Orthodox Church teaches a concept called logismoi, thoughts that enter into our heads that come from an external source. We have all had psychopathic thoughts before if we are being honest with ourselves and this is a form of "revelation" under the currently described definition. 

Now Revelation can either be Divine or Demonic, in which case it is more proper to call delusion. 

It is important to note as well, that even pagans from antiquity, such as the Oracle at Delphi, did not claim to see the future or other things. Rather they were revealed these things by the spirits that they interacted with. 

Richard Dawkins does not believe in using this form of knowledge for any type of Truth claim. He completely dismisses the idea of a Hyperousiastic being capable of communicating with creatures. 


## Strict Materialism 

"I think it's somewhat secondary to scientific facts—facts that tell us how old the universe is, how old the world is, the history of life, the engineering achievements like landing a spacecraft on a comet. These are the things that science can do. And, as I said, the predictions of quantum theory—coming back to that—are verified to a sufficient number of decimal places that it's equivalent to predicting the width of North America to one hair's breadth. Now, as difficult as quantum theory is to understand, that is what you can get from quantum theory. The mysteries of the Bible, if they are mysteries, aren’t in the same league. I mean, they just don’t cut it." - Richard Dawkins 

In the above quote, we can see that the underlying lack of epistemology is present, however, we can also see that Richard Dawkins also lacks the worldview that values mysteries/miracles. 

It is essential to a Christian worldview to accept and acknowledge phenomena that cannot be scientifically explained. As we have seen already the scientific worldview rejects one of the four epistemics required for a Christian worldview. This epistemic is required to believe in God at some level, ultimately necessary for Cultural Christianity. 

In other words, he cannot be a cultural Christian because he does not support the existence of a thing that requires an epistemic that he clearly denies. 


## Conclusion 

Richard Dawkins is acting hypocritically and insults Christianity by insinuating that it is merely a set of cultural practices that one can follow without respecting their logical conclusions. We must pray for this man, that he will cease this claim and act in the Truth. He is not a cultural Christian because he does not acknowledge Spiritual reality, lacks the epistemics needed to be a Christian, and perceives the world in a strictly materialist sense.
