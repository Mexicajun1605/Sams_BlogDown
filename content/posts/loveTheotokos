## Why I love the Theotokos/Mary 

### DISCLAIMER  
Before accepting anything that I say, please consult with your nearest Orthodox priest. I am not responsible for any heresies that result from you reading this. 


### Intro 
In the world I grew up in, veneration of the Theotokos, aka. the Virgin Mary, was controversial. It was often considered a form of idolatry. I was told that it was outright sinful and pointless. After all, why venerate Mary if Paul writes to Timothy in his first letter " For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;" 

I think that this is missing the point. The entirety of love and devotion to Our Mother is ultimately directed toward God himself through the one who He chose as his door to the world. This person is, excepting the Theanthropos and GodMan, Jesus, the most holy human to have ever lived.   

This verse is often used to describe why the intercession of all saints, not just the Theotokos is invalid. However, when we compare this to places in Scripture, it makes no sense. For example, James 5:16 states "Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much."

What then is meant by mediator in the first letter to Timothy? If we are to understand mediator in the classical Protestant sense, then this understanding is immediately debunked by St. Paul himself in verse 1 of the same chapter. "I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men;" If Paul is suggesting something like the cessation of intercessory prayer to the saints, then why does he encourage it? It simply does not make sense. Another common rebuttal to this is that they are dead. However, is not God the God of the living and not the dead? Are the saints who are in the presence and unity of God not more alive than we here below? It simply makes no sense to use this passage 

### The love of a Mother for her Son  

The love that Christ has for the world extends to the Theotokos. And it is undeniable that she is special among all creation. This is seen in John 2, when the first public miracle of Jesus occurs at the suggestion of the Theotokos. Christ even appears reluctant to perform it. Nonetheless, the intercession of his Mother appears to have some effect. 


### Container of the Uncontainable God  
This is one of the titles that is used for the Theotokos in one of the most ancient and profound hymns dedicated to her, the Akathist to Our Most Holy Lady Theotokos. Take a moment to consider what this means.  

The infinite and uncontainable and indescribable God and fashioner of the Cosmos dwelt within the confines of a human being. The implications behind this are to put it theologically... bonkers.  

One implication of this almost seems to suggest that the Theotokos is in a way the gate to God. This is reflected in another title used for her in the Akathist, "Heavenly ladder by which God came down." In the ancient liturgy of the Orthodox Church, one of the common reading for Marian feasts is that of Jacob's ladder. The History of Christianity and the Akathist point to her as this ladder, the gateway by which the Creator chose to enter the world.  

Consider further that she is the one who has "united opposites." If "God became man, so that man might become God" as St. Athanasius says, what does this mean? 


### The Prime Example  

The Theotokos is also without a doubt the prime example of a Christian. She was among the first to receive the Holy Spirit at Pentecost, was taken up bodily into Heaven, and mastered the contemplation of silent evangelism. 

#### The Annunciation and Theosis  

One of the mysteries that I contemplate on frequently is the Annunciation. This mystery confounds me with what it could mean. Before proceeding, let me discuss Theosis. As in the previous St. Athanasius quote, "God became man, so that man might become God," this is the goal of every Christian, to synergistically unite with God through the indwelling of the Holy Spirit via the energies of the Lord. While the essence of God is unknowable, we can participate in His energies. Consider 2 Peter 1:4 where the disciple says that we "become partakers of the Divine Nature." Further consider John 14:20-24 where Christ says "In that day you will know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you. Whoever has my commandments and keeps them, he it is who loves me. And he who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and manifest myself to him.” Judas (not Iscariot) said to him, “Lord, how is it that you will manifest yourself to us, and not to the world?” Jesus answered him, “If anyone loves me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him. Whoever does not love me does not keep my words. And the word that you hear is not mine but the Father's who sent me."  

Having very briefly considered the mystery of Theosis, I wonder what John 14 means for the willingness of the Theotokos to synergize with the will of God. Rarely does it occur in Scripture that prophets cooperate consistently with God. St. Moses has a speech impediment and likes to hit rocks instead of speaking to them, St. Jonah straight goes the opposite direction, St. Solomon gives the go ahead to idolatry and adultery, St. David went with murder and adultery, and so on and so forth. I do not bring this up to speak ill of these saints, but rather to emphasize the holiness of the Theotokos. From the moment she was brought into the temple at three years old, to her death, she was faithful to God. And this faithfulness includes even the greatest declaration that any human being has ever received from the Divine, that He would come and dwell within them. As the conversation between St. Gabriel and the Theotokos goes in Luke 1 26-38,  

"In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth, to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. And the virgin's name was Mary. And he came to her and said, “Greetings, O favored one, the Lord is with you!” But she was greatly troubled at the saying, and tried to discern what sort of greeting this might be. And the angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus. He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. And the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.”

And Mary said to the angel, “How will this be, since I am a virgin?”

And the angel answered her, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be called holy—the Son of God. And behold, your relative Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son, and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren. For nothing will be impossible with God.” And Mary said, “Behold, I am the servant of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word.” And the angel departed from her."  

And there it is. "Let it be to me according to your word." Who says this to God? More than anyone else, the Theotokos cooperated with God to the point that God literally comes into the world via her body. What greater example could we ask for that her love for God manifests in his descending from Heaven into human flesh? This is not to say that the Incarnation was by the will of the Theotokos, not by any means. Rather, I think that this indicates that the Theotokos demonstrates her shining of the Holy Spirit and her cooperation with the will of God that God saw her love for Him and decided to dwell within her as the new Ark of the Covenant. 

### Personal Experience  

Fr. Paul Truebenbach, a priest in Salt Lake City, released a series of videos for catechumens, people being initiated into the Church. In this series he stated that there are only 3 prayers a Christian truly needs, 1. the Our Father, 2. The Jesus Prayer, 3. Most Holy Theotokos save us.  

I have taken these words seriously in my own life and have felt the presence of the Theotokos in my prayers. Initially this occurred during the liturgy when I looked upon her icon in contemplation, only for her contemplation of me to surpass any kind of meditation I could have upon her mysteries. In other words, merely with the look of her icon, I can feel that she is indeed, the Queen of Heaven, and that she loves everyone.  

"Most Holy Theotokos save us" or "me" as I often pray it, is something that I also have been feeling strongly in my prayers. Often I will use the Chotki to go around with this prayer and meditate on the love of the Theotokos. In meditating on the love she has for me, I imagine the love she has for her Son. This same son is the one whose image is engraved on my heart. How can she not have love for me or anyone else when the image of her Son is engraved on the essence of our hearts?   

When I pray this in front of her icon, I even feel her eyes begin to perceive me. The teachings on icons is vindicated for me when this occurs and suddenly the image is now a window into the reality of the new Ark of the Covenant bearing God and staring back at me with love and forgiveness.  

Her intercession and prayer and presence in my life is important. She truly does bring me closer to our Creator, the blessed Trinity. 

Most Holy Theotokos save us
