# How to learn any language

Charlemagne said that for every language that one learns, he has another soul. Learning languages is a fairly simple task. It does not take a great intellect or talent, but rather pure consistency and devotion. Any language, anywhere, can be mastered by anyone. The only questions are how many languages do you want to learn and to what level and which languages?

This leads into step 1

# 1. Decide on your language 

This might seem a little silly at first to someone who does not routinely attack different languages for fun. However, I can tell you from first hand experience that passion and availability are crucial and key to success. While it is true in theory that a white American of German descent from Kansas can learn Amharic to a C2 level while maintaining a 9-5 full time job, it is not realistic to expect this. And we should tamper our expectations to choose languages that lead us to more success, classical languages being a slight exception. 

For those who are beginning a language (as speakers of a Western European language) I would recommend something from the FSI's category I languages. The FSI (Foreign Service Institute, link [here](https://www.state.gov/foreign-language-training/)) measures languages on a variety of parameters and classifies them according to difficulty, I being the easiest and IV the hardest. If you are new, start at category I with either French or Spanish, or Portuguese if you want to be different. 

The sad truth of the matter is that while any language can be mastered anywhere, the likelihood of mastery/proficiency decreases as you move further away both geographically and culturally with your goal. 

# 2. Change your perspective

Unlike any other skill you have likely learned in your life, language learning is something you never fully conquer and will be struggling with your whole life. If you get to this step, and do not like it, you should choose another goal. Language learning in its truest sense involves understanding something different and foreign to you. For example, I have been speaking and studying Spanish, am married to a native speaker, and have a Masters degree in the subject and I still learn new things every day. This is a continuous and never ending journey. In fact, I am a native English speaker who still learns new things about English every day. 

Given this, we must learn to change our perspectives. Like getting to know another human being takes a long time (some more than others), likewise it costs time to know a language. Language learning is not a single accomplishment, it is a lifelong journey. 

# 3. Determine the level you want

Many people say that they want to be conversational or fluent. This is not helpful. What the hell do these terms mean? If I can ask "Hola, ¿Cómo estás?" and reply "Bien, ¿y tú?" ("Hello, How are you?" and "Fine, and you?"), does this make me conversational? It is certainly a conversation, albeit a small one. Nonetheless, it seems completely unimpressive. What is the goal? What is the attempt to accomplish here?

We often ignore these questions when learning new languages nonethless, they are important. For example, while I might struggle to speak in Koine Greek, that was not my goal. My goal with Koine is to read the New Testament. And with the help of [Learning with Texts](https://learning-with-texts.sourceforge.io/), I am doing just that. If I can do that, but not speak well, that's ok because it was never the goal to begin with. Likewise, if you are learning Thai just to vacation in Thailand, and learn just enough Thai for the trip, well done! 

While learning the language, always remember your goal. 

I would recommend the [CEFR](https://www.coe.int/en/web/common-european-framework-reference-languages/table-1-cefr-3.3-common-reference-levels-global-scale) for determining this goal.

# 4. Down to brass tacks and learning the basics

Step 4 or step 1 of the actual doing of things, is to get to brass tacks and study the language. This is where you actually have to put into practice the perspective and philosophy above. 

Thankfully though, language consists of repeating parts. For example, the distribution of vocabulary in any language is roughly Zipfian. This is a statistical principal that means that 80% of anything is composed of 20% of its component parts. For example, 80% of English is composed of the top 20% of most common vocabulary. If you can learn that, you're golden! Follow this principle as you learn your language. No language, as far as I am aware, breaks this principle. 

I recommend learning the words in the Swadesh list of your language of choice as well. Swadesh lists are collections of the most commmon vocabulary in a given language. Upload these to Anki or whatever flashcard program you want and study. 

A language is like a house and the vocabulary is the bricks or the material used to build. In other words, it is the foundation of the language.   

# 5. Learn the grammar

Now that you have some vocabulary under your belt, it is time to learn the bluprints with which to build the house that is your language. This is what the grammar is. 

Many fear grammar and choose to ignore it due to its systematic and perceived erratic nature. However, as you begin to use the grammar of any language, it will become clear that the grammar feels natural. Really I cannot quantify this, but will provide an analogy. 

In English, when we want to intensify the effect of a verb, we often reduplicate it. For example "Sam like likes Diana." This sentence really means "Sam loves Diana." In Koine Greek, we duplicate a part of the verb, the first consonant and the phoneme /ε/, to indicate the completion or perfection of said verb. For example, "Παυλος λυει τον δουλον."(Paul frees the slave) vs "Παυλος λελυκε τον δουλον"(Paul has freed the slave.)

Perhaps this example is opaque to those unfamiliar with Greek, but the point stands. The grammar of language X feels and is natural to those who speak language X. And as foreigners, our job is to conform to that. 

# 6. Repetition, Repetition, Repetition

Once you have completed a grammar course and learned the basic vocab, the only linguistic thing left to do is really expose yourself to the language. Start using if left and right, front and center. 

This is the part that truly does take a long time. Just as we spent years to learn our native language, so too will it take a long time with the 2nd and 3rd and 4th etc. Patience is the key. If anyone continues to study for long enough and immerse themselves for long enough, they will reach the goal. 

In this step, you should be reading with a dictionary, listening to podcasts watching tv, etc. In short, do anything you would do anyway, but in language X instead of the native lang. 

Additionally, listen to the language constantly. Language is music and has rhythm. English has a rhythm, Portuguese has one, Spanish, etc. Through extensive listening we acquire this rhythm and match its patterns onto our new vocabularies and grammars as we did when we were infants. I cannot overemphasize the importance of listening. 

# 7. Learn the culture

Perhaps this is more of a guiding light than a step, but I will include it anyway. The culture shapes the language and vice-versa. This will change the way you see the world, once you realize that the target language speakers do not see it like you do. 

Perhaps the completion of events is more important than the time they ocurred? Perhaps the act of loving is both passive and active? Any number of observations can occur at this level, however, we should be observing actively. 

Through active observation, we not only learn about the culture, but we learn about the language and the world. For example, while studying Greek, I came across the word koinonia, the fellowship or commonness of two or more things. This noun is often translated fellowship, yet it is derived from the adjective that means common. Thus we can infer that something common was necessary for fellowship in Ancient Greece. 

Furthermore, as you learn the language, you will encounter new terms for unfamiliar concepts. If you would like some good examples, google "saudade," a Portuguese word or "agape," for a Greek example. 

# Conclusion

I hope that you have learned something from this article and that you put it into practice. Learning a new language can and should be practiced by all human beings on the planet. If we did this, the world would be a better place and we would all have koinonia.
