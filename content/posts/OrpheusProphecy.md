# Sing Muse, the love of Orpheus

Today's post will be a poem I wrote recently about the story of Orpheus and Eurydice. I find the paralells between Christ and Orpheus so striking that it makes me consider and wonder about the proto-evangelization of the Greeks, yet again. 

If you are not familiar with the story of Orpheus, you can find a link to the story [here](). Otherwise, I will tell you just enough for you to understand the story. 

Orpheus had the fortune of obtaining the lyre of Apollo, son of Zeus, god of light and reason. He is often also equated with the Sun even though the Titan Helios held that position before him. Nonetheless, Orpheus acquired this lyre and became the greatest musician in the whole world. His wife was named Eurydice, however, she died after fleeing some satyrs who sought to rape her and fell onto a viper. 

Orpheus' tears were so powerful and his mourning so dreadful that the whole world wept and by the gods' behest he descended to Hades to recover her. 

While on the descent his luminous music won over Persephone, who allowed Eurydice to return to the world of the living if Orpheus not look back upon her until she had left Hades. Orpheus forgot this and she faded once more. 

Within a Christian framework we can see parallels to both Lot and to Christ. Lot is incapable of rescuing his family from the fires beset on Sodom and Gomorrah, while Christ famously harrows the souls of the just to be rescued unto Unity with Him, in His Death under the ground and in the tomb and in the Resurrection of His body. 

Orpheus appears to be between these two individuals. Unlike Christ, Orpheus did not die to go to the "infermundus," however, the story of the god-like being descending to rescue his Beloved from Death surely echos Christ's rescue of His Bride, the Church.

It may seem, more likely, that Orpheus is more like Lot, he had Faith and, in a way was granted the privilege of a life that the rest of the world was doomed to suffer without. Still, Orpheus and Lot were men and could not maintain a sinless(that is without hamartia, missing the mark) life. They could not let go of the prize of life eternal and lost it. 

Anyways, here is the poem. 

# Sing Muse, the love of Orpheus

From Heaven came a lyre  
And graced the artful sire,   
Orpheus the precursor  
Of He who freed from fire.  

And struck he Reason's strings  
And pluck Melody and things  
So that Hades blessings gave   
For his voice and lyre rings.   

Wherefore made he such descent?  
The life of Eurydice spent,   
To pass ages with the Maiden  
From mother had been rent.   

This is why by Logic Prophecy,   
Lowered he in Holy Rhapsody  
To presage the Messiah,   
In rescuing Eurydice.   

And yet Eve partakes  
Of fruit for life's sakes  
So that in Death sleep,   
Dies in dreams, 'nd ne'er wakes.  

But the Maiden beguiled  
By the sound so mild  
Let loose the beloved   
From the chaos and wild.   

While life was gained,   
The Maiden ordained,   
He look not on love   
While Hades maintained.   

Here Humanity fails,   
Looking back travails  
In salt to fall and fade,   
Without mark, none prevails.   

What man cannot produce,   
Even when Hell doth loose,   
The Son of Man reveals,   
Life unto Euryidice and Orpheus.
