title: What even is real anymore?

## What even is real anymore?

I would like to preface my following thoughts. I do not have all the answers nor do I claim to. Final preposition on purpose. Rather I would like to elaborate on some thoughts I have been having recently. 

In the last few years, I have learned so much about how the world around us is not real. The money is not real. American Fiat dollars are backed by nothing and are literally worth as much as Monopoly money in the sense that they can be printed ad infinitum. Many jobs, particularly administrative and bureaucratic work not only is useless and provides nothing to society, but also sometimes is actively harmful. Within the realm of Philosophy it appears that, at least in the West, everyone has adopted relativism. What is true for one individual is not true for another. Despite being a civilization that prides itself on scientific prowess, this is far from the Scientific Method. How did we get here?

Many of these things are fictions. Fictions are tools of the human mind that we use for various purposes. A silly example is that Pikachu is yellow. Pikachu is fictional, but within the fiction in which he is established, it is a fact that he is yellow, to say otherwise would be false. The fact of the matter is that Pikachu is yellow. Another example, Fiat money or USD, or British pounds, euros, etc, are all fictions. What exactly is a dollar, beyond some bits stored on a computer or the actual paper itself? Or in the case of pennies which are literally worth less than the materials their made of, where is the value? The reality is that this exists only in our minds. While other reality based moneys exist such as Gold and Bitcoin, which I plan on writing on why this is different from dollars online in another blog post, this does not mean that Fiat is useless. It is merely a tool that facilitates transactions or other ends. Other fictions we treat as real are countries, corporations, some academic theories such as Marxism, etc. 

While it may be easy to notice the lack of natural difference between the US Southwest and Mexico where God never drew a line in the sand to show which side is which, others are more difficult. For example, so called Gender theory that separates sex and gender is also a fiction. Just like countries these things are not grounded in the reality in which we live, but serve means and ends of their own. In the case of nation states it is to extract taxes and enforce monopolies on violence and in the case of Gender theory to sell drugs and perpetuate an industry, both pharmaceutical and media, based off a fiction that dictates the lives of so many people. 

The difference between a theory and a fiction is that the former provides and explanation for reality and the latter dictates another reality. For example, linguistics provides theories on language such as the Indo-European hypothesis. We can use the Scientific method to test this hypothesis and come to a conclusion on the relationships between certain languages, how old they are, where they were likely spoken and so on. We can apply this to other real sciences such as Biology, Astronomy, Anthropology, etc.  

Examples of fiction are different. While Pokemon may be consistent within and of itself, I cannot, outside a computer of course, observe the behaviour, color, smell, or other attributes of Pokemon. Nonetheless it is a consistent explanation of a world that could exist. Some of the current economics in the world shows how this thinking is in error. Fractional Reserve Lending, for example, deviates from the theory of Economics, and creates a fiction of wealth from nowhere. If the bank knows that all of its customers will not withdraw all of their funds at once, then the system works and shows that this is a theory not a fiction. However, this former statement is false and the bank cannot know this. There is never a 0 possibility of there not being a bank run on any particular day and time and time again, reality shows that Fractional Reserve Lending is a fiction. 

Discerning theory from fiction has historically been much easier. If you were a Medieval farmer in Spain, you could easily distinguish the fictions of Amadis de Gaula from Christianity, which I will defend as a theory of reality and existence itself with other religions in a later post. However, there are Don Quixotes in this world. 

Our task now in the age of AI is the same as that of Don Quixote, reconciling our theories and our fictions and sorting them out into their proper categories. However, unlike the Medieval Spanish farmer, we are constantly deluged with information, theories and fictions alike. And furthermore, especially in the United States, these theories and fictions have been politicized ad nauseam. What therefore are we to do when confronted with this Hydra? 

Beyond this, we are in an era in which the boundaries between what is theory and fiction and real and not will become even more difficult to discern. In 2021 a series of memes circulated showing famous people from history singing Pop songs, my favorite was Stalin singing "Video killed the radio star." While this is innocent and fun with Stalin singing a girly pop song, couldn't someone do the same thing with media depicting Hitler and other WW2 leaders to backup NeoNazi propaganda? How would we know the difference. StableDiffusion, an open source AI can take text prompts now and create images from its vast database. It is but a matter of time before such atrocities begin to proliferate on the web. 

Honestly this thinker does not know what the solution is. I believe that we must go back to fundamentals within our education system and learn to think more within a Classical and Medieval framework, and to base our realities on the most boiled down postulates and axioms we can and work from there. Questions like, 

1. Can I observe this?
2. Can I measure this?
3. Can I construct a framework from which the elements I observe consistently interact in a logical way?
4. Can I compare this against historical examples?

Perhaps instead of an answer, we should ask more questions instead. 

Using logic and reason, we can name and measure and define the world we live in. And now more than ever, is this ability crucial to what it means to be an intelligent person in the world. We cannot believe in a reality based on fiction because fictions will conflict. This leaves us with the demanding task of defining our reality with theory. 

While we may not know all Truth, we can come closer and closer to it. Choosing to live in fiction is missing the mark and should not be celebrated. We should respect the absolute Truth of Nature, from the Latin meaning, that which is becoming born. Nobody is born wrong, nor is this world something to dictate with fiction, but rather to celebrate in its Truth that we learn and observe daily. 

I will leave you with quotation from Descartes that he attributed to an angel. 
"The conquest of nature shall be through number and measure."

God bless you and keep you, and may we do our best to discern as we can.
