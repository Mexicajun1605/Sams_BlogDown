# Why you should not vote for the lesser of two evils 

This post will not be endorsing either Donald Trump or Kamala Harris. Both have flaws in the way they perceive the world and in the ways they govern. Rather, I seek to address a systemic flaw in the way the American mind thinks. 
Most Americans feel they often have no choice when election time comes around, and in many ways, that's 100% true. However, the polarization around candidates is not about the good things they have promised to do, but the bad things that the other will not. This is commonly summed up in the phrase "lesser of two evils." 
To be honest and straightforward, this is groupthink, stupid, and nonsense. The red team and the blue team both suck. Because of this, I propose that Americans should only vote for candidates that they find acceptable and not evil, otherwise not voting. I will be strengthen this opinion with the following three points. 

1. It logically makes no sense
2. Voting for a lesser evil is voting for evil 
3. This system self-perpetuates more evil 

I am sure that I could come up with more points, however, as Aristotle said, all good things come in threes. 

## It makes no sense 

Lets imagine a situation where a vegan person is with friends and the group is making plans on where to eat. All of the friends, except the vegan, are proposing eating out at either a burger place or getting cheese pizza. If the vegan uses the decision making algorithm of "lesser of two evils," then he will wind up eating cheese pizza and breaking his principles. 

If the vegan would prefer to maintain his diet, the better decision would be to let the other friends eat elsewhere or bring his own food. It makes no sense for him to eat the same thing as the friends. It simply does not accord to his own values and there is an alternative. 

From this point of view, we can see that voting is similar. If the entire country chooses to vote for morons, which is sadly the case, then individuals are free to choose to vote for a third party or to abstain. 

Furthermore, if we compare this to the reality of the situation, there are always third parties and not voting is also a vote, comparable to the vegan choosing to leave his friends and do his own thing. There is no such thing as truly "not voting." 

## Voting for the lesser of two evils is still voting for evil 

I think the statement above is quite explanatory. If both of the main choices in a political system are non-satisfactory, it logically follows that voting for either of them will result in an undesirable outcome. 

If we compare our vegan friend from before with the current political climate, we can see that if he votes to get cheese pizza, he is still betraying his own interests. Is it better for a vegan to eat dairy than meat, if he will still be betraying his own interests ultimately? Voting for evil is voting for evil, regardless of the degree. 


## Self Perpetuating Evil 

The final point, continuing to vote for evil will perpetuate evil. Supposing that the two candidates that are eligible are both evil, continuing to provide them with votes allows their parties and campaigns, etc. to conclude that their actions are popular and that they are loved by half of the country. After all, numbers don't lie! Except that they do. How many people would vote for another candidate given a realistic chance at election? This question is obscured by the data in place. 

Moreover, if party x nominates a candidate with somewhat extreme opinions, those views can be implemented over time as the menace of the alternative candidate grows. This both locks in the votes necessary to maintain power due to fear of the other candidate and allows the party x's candidates to become gradually more extreme.  

Furthermore, if we use a syllogism and an analogy here, we can come to the conclusion that we ourselves, as voters, are guilty of comitting evil in voting for the "lesser of two evils." For example, 

Killing puppies is evil 
Candidate X wants to kill puppies 
Therefore giving Candidate X a gun to kill puppies is evil 

Compare 

Killing puppies is evil
Candidate X wants to kill puppies 
Therefore giving Candidate X a political position that grants the power to kill puppies is evil 

## Conclusion 

Vote for good or do not vote at all. Voting for evil candidates makes no sense, is evil, and self-perpetuates. 
While the responsibility of Trump and Kamala's actions should be held to them personally, I think we should become more sober-minded as voters and consider that we are partially to blame for every child denied entry into a safe country, every complication in the healthcare system, etc. if the candidate we voted for commits or enables such acts. We are not only individuals.
