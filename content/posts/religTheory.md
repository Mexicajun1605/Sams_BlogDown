# Religion is Theory

# What is a theory? 

To start off this post, we need to ask a very relevant question. What is a theory? A theory is an explanation for something that we can observe. For example, nobody has ever been able to "prove" that there is such a thing as Gravity. Nonetheless, the theories behind gravitation that physicists have been produced are good and satisfactory enough that we accept them as the explanations for phenomena we experience in our everyday lives. Nonetheless it cannot be proven. 

Ultimately when we use theories, they do not have to be necessarily relevant or correct. For example, we can theorize that Taco Bell is popular because its employees are filling the tacos with addictive and mind-controlling chemicals. While this does indeed explain the phenomenon of the ubiquity of Taco Bell, it does not explain why some people do not like it, why some eat there once in a while, why some like it but choose not to eat there, etc. Thus we can make a new theory that Taco Bell is popular because it is cheap. This explains the aforementioned questions much more efficiently. 

This method of theory refinement, moving towards theories that explain more phenomena than others, is ultimately our foundation of understanding the world. Beyond theories, we only have postulates, the foundation and most atomic part of a statement/argument, and axioms, statements that are declared/given to be true, i.e. 1+1 = 2, etc. 

Using theory, postulates, and axioms, we can come to a closer understanding of the world. 

# The failings of Science as theory towards certain questions  

Science is the scientific method. 

In the modern world, we have thrown out philosphy for so called "Science" or Scientism, a religion that holds the Scientific method as its gospel. The problem with the scientific method as a theory for explaining the world can be seen when we analyze it. Broadly speaking the scientific method can be summarized as follows. 

1. We observe a phenomenon that we want to explain
2. We come up with a hypothesis to explain the phenomenon
3. We test the hypothesis
4. Repeat as necessary

While Science is excellent for describing the exterior or physical world, it begins to struggle as the size of datasets increase. For example, science is fallible to what I call the Black Swan fallacy. Prior to the discovery of the Americas, Europeans had never seen a Black Swan. Thus following the scientific method, Europeans in 1492 could have come to the conclusion that black swans do not exist. 

In Scientific Method 
1. Are swans only white?
2. Hypothesis: Swans are not only white
3. Define a number of swans to observe and document the colours 
4. Repeat until a satisfactory outcome is achieved

This experiment would have supported the theory that there are no Black Swans if you were European prior to 1492. 

Science also fails with basic questions such as the fundamental nature of things. For example, we know that everything is made of atoms, made of protons, neutrons, and electrons, made of quarks. But what are the quarks made of? Do you continue like this Turtles all the way down? How can something exist when there is nothing at its most fundamental nature?

These are questions that Science can not answer. While, as the angel said to Descartes, "The conquest of nature is to be through number and measure," we cannot conquor ourselves or deeper questions this way. 

# Philosophy and Religion, for when science fails 

As per the last section, while science is great for that which is discovered via inductive reasoning and describing phenomena that are observed with the senses, it struggles with these deeper questions. However, we can solve these questions using Philosophy. 

Philosophy literally means love of wisdom in Greek and is defined by Logic. Logic and science do not always necessarily go hand in hand. For example, the type system in Pokemon, where water moves are effective against fire type pokemon etc, is a logical system, however, it is not scientific. Nonetheless it sustains itself. While we can use logic to describe fictional worlds, we can also use it to describe reality. This is where Plato, Aristotle, and Socrates come in. 

If Socrates is the founder of Philosophy, Plato refined it, and Aristotle fit it to the observable world. Socrates first lays the ground work of how we are to come towards a problem, the Socratic method. Entering into a dialogue with the person or thing you wish to understand and then drilling down into the root of the question. 

Plato refines this by coming to the conclusion that there is an essence vs existence distinction. For example, if there is a ball, what makes the ball a ball? The ball is composed of a series of characteristics such as density, shape, etc. These characteristics are the essences of the ball. According to Plato, these essences exist in a higher realm. And unlike Pokemon, these characteristics can be observed in our real world. Pythagoras was also particularly interested in this idea and came to the conclusion that numbers, particularly one and two, were the foundations of all things. 

The key takeaway from the previous paragraph is that everything that exists has an essence. Everything exists post priori its essence. Essence preceeds existence. 

Whether you are more inclined to Pythagoras or Plato, their argument for a logical foundation or floor to the universe/existence is solid. What can be more basic than 1? Since numbers do not have a further essence to them, they cannot be further divided and exist as a logical system that governs reality. 

# Christianity and the Logos

The Gospel of John takes this concept further and identifies this floor of reality with God. Logic, "Logos", is the same thing as God to the Gospel writer. Logos is specifically borrowed from Platonism. It is a sentient thing that creates and gives life to everything. If you doubt the capacity for a logical system to create, consider the medium through which you are reading this, a computer. The computer depends on logic and numbers to create a world and system based off of only 1 and 0. Now imagine what a recursive infinity of number sets could accomplish! It literally is, by definition, all knowing and omnipresent! And if you believe in Christianity, it is also all loving. 

Looking at John 1:1 this way, we now have a logical and coherent explanation for God 

# A similar idea in Hinduism

Since we have now used Platonic form theory to create a cohesive explanation for the existence of everything and God, I think it would be apt to describe a similar idea from Hinduism. 

In many schools of Hinduism, there is the concept of Atman and Brahman. Brahman appears to be equivalent to the Logos in that it is the creator and source of all things. The Atman, meanwhile, is the individual soul. Nonetheless, how do we describe and explain individual perception and existence? According to the theory of Atman and Brahman, the latter is like the ocean and full of waves. When the waves grow they separate the tips into drops that individuate but eventually reunite with the water. This is how existence functions according to this school of Hindu thought and how we relate to the Logos. 

# Mythology != Religion

Finally I would like to denoue the idea that Mythology and Religion are the same thing. 

Mythology is the series of stories and tales that a religion may or may not use to convey the deeper Truth that it contains. For example, we know that the world was not created in 7 days literally. However, the number 7 is a symbol for completion in Jewish culture and thus, 7 days signifies that the Universe is whole and complete, not missing anything. 

Religion is composed of the philosophical and logical foundations that describe the world and ourselves. For example, the theory of Dharma in Hinduism is similar to the idea of an ecological niche. All animals will eventually find their ecological niche and fulfill it. Dharma is a more cosmic equivalent that we are free to disobey, generating good karma upon fulfillment and bad karma upon failure. This theory of Dharma is similar to the Christian idea that God has created everything with a purpose. 

Contrasting the aforementioned ideas of God's plan for everything and Dharma shows us that contrasting mythologies, i.e. Hindu and Christian, can still convey the same deeper Truth, e.g. God/Brahman has a plan or a place for everything. 

# Conclusion 

While reading this over, I think I might have to write another post to explain this one, however, I hope the point is clear that religions are theories for existence. When we separate them from their Mythologies they are coherent explanations for everything that we can observe.
