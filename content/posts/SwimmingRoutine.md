## Getting back in shape through swimming

The best way to take care of your physical health through exercise is swimming, at least in my opinion. Swimming works every muscle in your body and can be as intense or chill as you would like. Furthermore, it establishes good habits that can apply to other areas of exercise. For example, learning a pattern for breathing is useful not only in swimming but also running. 

In this post I will be writing up a plan for getting back into shape through swimming. It may be considered fairly intense or light though, depending on where you are at. The philosophy behind this routine is to build up slowly and gradually to consistent 3000 yard/meter workouts. 

The exact sets described are only an example of what you can do. In my experience, basing things off distance works the best as opposed to timed sets or intensity. Therefore, whatever you decide, try to keep up the distance you have committed to. Remember taking breaks if you need them is ok too. However, try not to take more than 30 seconds between sets or parts of sets.  

# Week 1

5 x 200

Total: 1000

The first week is mainly to get your body used to being back in the water and moving. My reccommendation is to alternate Breastroke, Free, Breastroke, etc. or vice-versa. However, you can do this with any stroke you like. 

# Week 2

6 x 200

Total: 1200

The second week is where we start to apply the philosophy. Do the same as the week before except with one more 200. 

# Week 3

5 x 200, alternate breast and free, however you want paced
2 x 100, either kicks or free, fast pace
1 x 300, free, slow

Total: 1500

This week's routine is starting to get you to increase the heart rate with the 2 hundreds in the middle and to get you swimming further like we will be doing in the weeks to come. 

# Week 4

3 sets descending speed

1 x 300 free
1 x 300 breast

Total: 1800

This week is similar to the second week in that it is where we start to push just a little bit more but with distance this time. If you would like to get your heart rate up, I reccommend doing this by starting off at a faster pace for the first set, medium second, and slow third. 

# Week 5

3 sets at all medium speed

1 x 300 free, into and without stopping
1 x 300 breast

End with 300 Kick

Total: 2100

This week you will still be putting in the same number of strokes as the week before, however, you will be doing so more at once. Last week you were permitted a small break between the freestyles and the breastrokes; not this week. You should be swimming these in three 600s half free, half breast. 

# Week 6

Warmup 

1 x 100 kick

2 sets, 1st medium 2nd slow

1 x 600 free, into and without stopping
1 x 600 breast

1 x 100 kick

Total: 2600

At this point you should be able to swim further at a medium pace without stopping which is the entire point of this routine. Do not worry so much about speed as technique and breathing. My reccommendation would be to try to reduce breathing to every 5 strokes or maybe even 7. 

# Week 7

Warmup 

1 x 300 kick

3 sets at medium pace

1 x 500 Free
1 x 300 Breast

Cooldown 

1 x 300 Kick

Total: 3000

Here we are. If you have made it this far, congratulations! By now you should know what to do. 

My philosophy on using swimming to get back in shape is to lose yourself in the water and let your body follow the rhythm it is comfortable following. If you can go faster, do it, if not don't. If you plan on following this routine, try to shoot for 4/5 days a week in the water. 

I hope that this has helped you. 

Take care and just keep swimming!
