title: Truth is not facts

# Truth is more than facts 

The premise of this post will be that facts are merely a subset of the larger superset that is called Truth. All facts are truths, but not all truths are facts. 

This will seem very confusing to the modern western reader of this post. However, I will dismantle the idea of Scientifically declared facts as being the only proofs of Truth statements. 

## What is the Scientific Method 

This is a method of trying to understand the world based upon the following model. 
1. Observe a phenomenon 
2. Make a statement on that phenomenon (hypothesis) 
3. Devise a test to determine if the hypothesis is true 4. Report findings 
5. Repeat 

This model is very useful for understanding and exploring physical realities, however, it is utterly useless for understanding non-physical realities. Facts do not have to be scientific. For example, it is a fact that colors can be divided into warm and cool, however, there is no test that can be derived from the phenomena of color experience that explains the perceptual categorization of colors into warm and cool categories. 
We can also observe the scientific method break down when we begin to analyze interpersonal relationships. There is no scientific test that I can conduct to show that my wife loves me. Rather it is something that I must trust and perceive on my own in order to make a Truth Statement about such things. 

This can be extended to the personhood of all individuals. For example, it is entirely possible that everyone and everything in the world except you is not self aware. However, there is no scientific test for this theory.  

Another great example of this is fictions. 

## What are fictions 

Fiction, most often encountered in the realm of literary studies, describes a world in which there is a coherent system of truths. For example, it is a true statement to say that Pikachu is yellow. To say that Pikachu is green is a false statement. The reason why it is false is because it can be perceived in another coherent world that this is false. It is not a true statement to say that Pikachu is green. 

You may now be wondering, what is a world? A world is the order that determines how things work. For example, Pikachu belongs to the world of Pokemon. However, the world of Pokemon, despite being one that can be perceived through media, is not one that exists within our world, also called reality, outside storytelling. Storytelling includes, books, shows, videogames, etc. 

Now, using our example of Pikachu, we determine that he is scientifically yellow. We know this because we can use the Scientific method accordingly. If you are a Pokemon nerd, ignore the possibilities of shinies for a moment. 

1. I observe a yellow Pikachu (Observation) 
2. All Pikachus are yellow (Hypothesis) 
3. I play a copy of a Pokemon video game and look for as many Pikachus I can while documenting the perceived color (test) 
4. My conclusion is that all Pikachus are yellow (result and report)



## Spiritual reality 

Now that we have determined that it is indeed possible to have non-scientific truths in our world and to have scientific facts in other worlds, is it possible for there to be non-scientific facts in this world? If you assented to the possibility that other creatures are aware, or that someone loves you, or that the taste of coffee is indeed a thing, or that warm and cool are categories of colors, then there certainly are non-scientific truths in this world. 

From this conclusion, we can use the inductive method to infer that there is a spiritual world. If billions of people self report a religion or millions experience some form of supernatural phenomena, we must conclude that given these sample sizes, it is more coherent to affirm Spiritual reality as opposed to denying it. 

This can be upsetting to some western scientific materialists because it implies that there are things that can be experienced by beings that are outside of our ability to test and measure. By extension this means that there are limits on what we can and cannot know. This means that it is possible for there to be beings that are not bound by our limitations. It is understandable why this is unsettling for the modern westerner. 

## The Noetic handicap 

Because this is so unsettling, many western materialists will argue that there are no such beings, even if they assent to the truth that they could exist in this world coherently with logic. They will affirm this because they have not perceived such phenomena. However, I argue that this could potentially be due to a form of a spiritual handicap that has to do with the Noos. 

In Eastern Orthodox Christian theology the Noos refers to a type of spiritual eye or organ that acts as a sense for understanding the spiritual world. The Noos has been perceived under various names in various religions, including but not limited to terms such as "the third eye." 

I argue that modern western materialists are noetically handicapped in the way that a blind person is handicapped. While blind people can indeed experience light in some form or another usually, they most certainly do not experience sight. If the majority of the population were blind, that would not mean that things that can only be perceived by sight do not exist. In other words, the tree does indeed make a sound in the forest if there is nobody there to hear it. The same applies to the Spiritual reality that surrounds us. Simply because so many western materialists are noetically blinded, does not mean that their Truth claims are sustainable.
