title: The insane fun of Turkish Vowel Harmony

## Turkish and Vowel Harmony 

I just recently returned home from a trip to Europe and part of that included Istanbul. As I previously stated in my language learning goals post, I decided to give a try to Turkish. Unfortunately, I was not able to speak Turkish very well at all. However, I learned more about languages and how they work as well as a bit of Turkish culture. One of the craziest things to me about Turkish grammar is a phenomenon called Vowel Harmony. 

Vowel Harmony is a phenomenon that exists not only in Turkish, but in a few other languages around the world, including Mongolian, Tungusic, and some Siberian languages. This phenomenon is what happens when a language requires vowels in different parts of a word to agree based on their position of articulation. For example, Turkish uses the suffix "-da" in order to communicate location or origin. However, it changes the vowel based upon the articulation of the vowel in the previous syllable. Lets take a look at an example. 

1. İstanbul'da. (In Istanbul) 
2. İzmir'de (In Izmir) 

In the first example, we can see that the final /u/ is interpreted as a vowel articulated further to the back of the mouth. Because of this, the "-da" suffix takes the /a/ vowel. However, since /i/ is a front vowel, the /a/ is dragged further up to a mid position, harmonizing the vowels. This can occur also with rounding of vowels, leading to what I find to be hilarious words as in the following example. 

Here -nci represents the equivalent to the English -th after numbers
1. Bir -> Birinci 
2. İki -> İkinci 
3. Üç -> Üçüncü 

Perhaps it is childish of me, but I find that the rounding of the final /i/ creates a silly sounding and whimsical word. 

Anyway, there is some Turkish for you. I hope you enjoyed this post and that you have an excellent day. Güle güle
