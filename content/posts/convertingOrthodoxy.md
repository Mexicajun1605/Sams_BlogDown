# Why I decided to become Orthodox

## My background

Unsurprisingly, this post will be about how and why I decided to join the Orthodox Church.
Despite the fact that I have called myself Christian for most of my life, I have not been part of a Church in a long time.
I grew up in what I struggle to not consider a heresy, the Southern Baptist Church (This is only partially emotional, I was outright taught Arianism as a child and have only recently learned about what that is and why it is wrong).
I also attended a Catholic school for a large part of my growing up.
Ultimately, while I do not see myself ever becoming Baptist again or turning to Catholicism, I want to mention the roles that these two faiths had in helping me towards Orthodoxy.
Firstly, my Baptist upbringing gave me a solid understanding of the stories behind scripture, how to read the Bible spiritually and analytically, and that a foundation is important.
I especially would like to thank my mentors Richard Rhett and Ernie Hall.
Secondly, I want to thank my Catholic upbringing for teaching me more about the Saints, in particular the memorization of the Hail Mary, familiarity with the liturgical mass even if I refused to understand it when I was young, and the importance of service/living the gospel.

## Realizing I needed to come back to Christ

Outside of Chronological order, I think the following reasons have played a signifigant role in bringing me back to Church.

### 1. How Buddha helped lead me to the Church

I had previously been trying to deal with my problems using Zen practices and Buddhism.
To this day, I am grateful to Yasutani Roshi and his 8 Principles of Zen Buddhism and of course the Great Siddartha's Dhammapada.
However, there is something that the discipline of the mind and the Eightfold path could not provide me.
That was what is called in Buddhism a sangha, or community of believers.
I have and still have my doubts in Western Buddhists and their practices and so I considered what the American looking for peace should look for in a community of believers and clearly came to the realization that it was the Church.
If it had not been for this, I may not have found my way back.
Perhaps the legend of St. Iosaphat (Christianized version of Siddartha Gautama) is true. And perhaps Siddartha is a Saint indeed and his prayers played a role.
I do not know and I digress.

### 2. Latin

I think studying Latin made a difference in bringing me back to the Church.
When I learn languages, I tend to want to dive into the culture and literature of that language straight away.
Since Caesar and Cicero are far more difficult than hagiographies and the Vulgate, I tended toward the latter.
This exposed me to some of the core of the history of Western Christianity and revealed a new facet of scripture through the relationships between the modern languages and Latin alongside a deeper understanding of individual words in the scripture.

### 3. Getting Fired

Last year, I was fired from my job as a Data Analyst during the great tech layoffs of 2023.
I am not sure if that had anything to do with me losing my position and getting fired or not, but that is irrelevant.
What is relevant is that after that experience, I realized that I could not do everything on my own.
I needed help.
By no means am I uneducated.
I had spent all of 2022, learning how to code in Python, conduct analyses in R and write Markdown documents and presentations, statistics, natural language processing and analyses, webdesign, javascript, html & css, and more.
I had and still have a Masters degree, speak several languages, and none of that mattered.
I still got fired and it was not because I was not good enough.
Sometimes bad things happen.
I knew that I needed to fall back on Someone I could rely on.

### 4. Being directed towards Episcopalianism

Due to a personal event in the life of my family, my parents became Episcopalians and so naturally, to please them, I started attending Church with them when I still lived nearby.
I did this in spite of the fact that I had converted to Paganism and had chosen to worship Apollo.
The mass slowly started to change my views on this as I realized that the ancient mystery cults of Greece and Rome which inspired me to Paganism, were actually fulfilled in within the mass, and especially in the Eucharist.
I abandoned Paganism and began to attend Mass with my parents more regularly, despite not wanting to commit myself to the Episcopal Church entirely.
This was not a significant problem, however, since my Baptism was recognized, and I could take Communion.

I actually begin to cry sometimes when I remember tasting the Eucharist and eating of the Body and Blood of Christ.
I would hold back weeping sometimes when I remember walking back to the pew after kneeling at the altar rail and consuming the Host via intinction.
I was partaking of Divine Grace using the same method that Judas used to reveal himself as Christ's betrayer, my sinfulness being revealed, forgiven, and washed away in one gesture, as I looked up and saw the stained glass of my Redeemer by a lamb.
Even though when I was young, I thought that it was stupid for Catholics to think that the Eucharist actually became the Body and Blood, I now knew this to be true and that this moment should be the center of my life.

### 5. Leaving Episcopalianism

Later on, I began to attend an Episcopalian Church after I got fired from my analyst role that I worked so hard for.
I decided that I needed to get confirmed in the Anglican tradition and asked the priest on day 2 of visiting that parish.
Nonetheless, the bishop of the diocese was taking a long time to make a trip to town in order to confirm the new converts from other denominations or formerly baptized Christians.
I even began to pray for the archangel Uriel's intercession for confirmation, since Anglicans see him as the patron of that sacrament.

I took this time to learn about the Celtic Church in the early centuries of its time in the British Isles, the Oxford Movement, Anglo-Catholicism, and I became convinced that the Apostolic Tradition of Anglicanism did indeed go back all the way to the apostles.

Despite the time that the bishop was taking, I am thankful that he did in retrospect.
While the long wait was frustrating, it gave me the time to understand some more of what was going on in that parish.
That is to say, the priest, like many in the Anglican Communion in the 2020s, was promoting sin.
I do not think that I feel the need to be specific, but it made me question and wonder about the power and even the legitimacy of the sacraments that I had been receiving, especially the Eucharist.
How could I accept the Body and Blood of my Saviour from a priest that is promoting, not merely condoning, a sin.
I had come to that parish looking for the roots of the Church so that I could delve into her waters and be nourished and brought back to Christ.

It was very painful for me to admit it, but I could not continue attending that parish and I quietly left.

In short, the combination of these four experiences of Buddhism, the need for Help, the Latin language, and the Eucharist, helped lead me back to Christ and His Church.

## Feeling the Presence of the Lord (First Orthodox Vespers)

After a month or two of half-heartedly and casually attending a Presbyterian Church, I decided to visit the Orthodox Church in Las Cruces for a Vespers service.

Immediately upon entering, I could feel the difference in the place.
The notion of Heavenly Worship was real.
The smell of the incense and the literal presence of the saints and their watchful eyes through the icons penetrated me.
I felt the presence of them all there.
The chanting, from my current sponsor, that retold the story of the Council of Nicaea filled my heart with the brotherhood of my ancestors in Christ in the past.

What I soon discovered to be the most common of all Orthodox prayers impacted me as well, "Lord have mercy." I am not exaggerating when I say that this phrase is sometimes prayed over a hundred times in Orthodox services.

However, the most powerful thing that I felt though, was the gaze of Christ.
The right side icon of Christ Ruler of All, on the iconostasis or separation wall of the sanctuary, was a window.
On the other side, Christ Himself was looking at me, even more than I was looking at Him.
At the same time, I felt all of His Love for me as well as my shame for having let him down time and again, while I clumsily crossed myself and bowed with the other 3 parishioners who were in attendance.

I think that the prayer of "Lord have mercy" encapsulates perfectly what I was feeling that day when I entered into the Nave.
When someone charitably and honestly comes into this form of liturgy, I am not sure if there is anything you can feel besides those three words, "Lord have mercy."

## Finding a Church home

Several Sundays after attending the Church and getting to know the parish, I asked the priest if I could join as a Catechumen.
This last December the 17th, I was accepted into the parish as one.
I thank God, the Trinity, for having led me there.
I thank Mary the Theotokos, the prophet Samuel, the archangel Uriel, and Father Anthony of the Desert and all the saints for their prayers on my behalf to find a home in Christ and a church. 
I look forward to Pascha, when I will fully enter into the Church. 

Thank you for reading this and pray for me that I will grow closer to and learn to love the Lord even more. 

Δοξα σοι ο θεος, δοξα σοι, 
Gloria Patri et Filio et Spiritui Sancto, nunc et in saecula saeculorum
