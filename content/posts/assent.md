title: Faith will not save you!

# DISCLAIMER 
Please keep in mind that I am not a priest, nor do I have a degree or qualifications in Theology. I simply a linguist who has studied some Greek and loves the Lord. Please consult your nearest **Orthodox** priest before adopting anything I say. 

# Sola Fide is nonsense 
In this post, I will rant about how Sola Fide is nonsense. We will look at the Greek of John 3:16 and other verses commonly used to assert this heresy and explain what the True Christian alternative is. The English citations from scripture are from the New King James Version and the Greek is from the 1550 Stephanus. 

## First. What is Sola Fide
Sola Fide is one of a set of five Protestant doctrines that define that branch of Christianity. Sola Fide in particular states that faith is the only thing necessary for salvation. This is utterly false and presupposes an incorrect notion of salvation. True salvation is becoming one with God through his energies. If you are not familiar with the essence/energy distinction, I would suggest that you read [here](https://www.saintjohnchurch.org/saint-gregory-palamas-essence-energies-distinction/) about that before continuing. 

## Reason 1: The book of James 
James 2:24 

You see then that a man is justified by works, and not by faith only. 

ορατε τοινυν οτι εξ εργων δικαιουται ανθρωπος και ουκ εκ πιστεως μονον 

Let us begin our debunking of this heresy with some input from the brother of our Lord, the Disciple and Apostle James, first bishop of Jerusalem. If you peform a digram word study on some other popular translations of scripture, you will find that this is the only place in scripture where the word faith is followed by the word alone. 
While for Orhtodox and Catholics, this tends to suffice for debunking any notion of Sola Fide, let us continue in our quest for the Truth. 

## Reason 2: The Greek should often be translated faithfulness 
If you look at the Greek previously used in James 2:24, the word for faith is πιστεως, the feminine genitive of the noun πίστις. According to [Liddel and Scott](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=PI%2FSTIS), this word can be translated as either of the following commonly understood definitions of faith. 
1. Trust in others
2. Persuasion of a thing
3. in subjective sense, good faith, trustworthiness, honesty,

In our modern western understanding of the world in a materialist sense, we often default to the second definition, however, let us not forget that the other two are completely valid as well. 
Before continuing, I would like to expound a bit upon what is meant when we say faithfulness. For example, I have faith in my wife. What on earth does that mean? Does that mean that I assent to the persuasion that she exists? I would certainly hope so since she is my wife, but that would still be rather meaningless since by definition of her being my wife, I have a relationship with her. Let us compare this idea with faithfulness. I am faithful to my wife. Here we can see a more meaningful declarative statement. In being faithful to a wife, one must do certain things, not cheating, showing care and love, doing things unenjoyable for her, etc. In other words, being faithful to someone is a much more useful term to use when describing something/someone that is known to exist. 

Let us see what happens when we look at what Paul has to say in a verse that is commonly used to support Sola fide. 

Romans 3:27-28 

Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? Of works? No, but by the law of **faith**. Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by **faith** apart from the deeds of the law.  
που ουν η καυχησις εξεκλεισθη δια ποιου **νομου των εργων** ουχι αλλα δια νομου **πιστεως** λογιζομεθα ουν **πιστει** δικαιουσθαι ανθρωπον χωρις εργων νομου

If we are to take the words of the Brother of our Lord seriously, we run into some problems with the classical Protestant interpretation here. How can someone be judged by his faith and not by his works if it is through **πίστις** in Jesus Christ that salvation occurs. The answer is rather simple. We recourse to the other two definitions of the word. Try reading the above with those definitions in mind or by substituting the word "faithfulness" instead of faith. 

Compare this with some context in 

Romans 3:21-22 

But now the righteousness of God apart from the law is revealed, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets even the righteousness of God, through **faith in Jesus Christ**, to all and on all who **believe**. For there is no difference 

νυνι δε χωρις νομου δικαιοσυνη θεου πεφανερωται μαρτυρουμενη υπο του νομου και των προφητων δικαιοσυνη δε θεου δια **πιστεως ιησου χριστου** εις παντας και επι παντας τους **πιστευοντας** ου γαρ εστιν διαστολη

As we can see here, faithfulness once again makes much more sense as the translation to be used in light of the words of St. James. 


## Reason 3: Theosis as Salvation: Galatians 2 Or He must Increase and I must Decrease 
Theosis here refers to the process of becoming one with God. 

My apologies for the longer passage citation, however, I think that we really need context when discussing scripture, and for this reason, I have chosen to insert the entire passage needed below. 

Galatians 2:16-20 

| English    | Greek   |
| ---- | ----- |
| 16 knowing that a man is not [i]justified by the works of the law but by faith in Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law; for by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified. | 16 ειδοτες οτι ου δικαιουται ανθρωπος εξ εργων νομου εαν μη δια πιστεως ιησου χριστου και ημεις εις χριστον ιησουν επιστευσαμεν ινα δικαιωθωμεν εκ πιστεως χριστου και ουκ εξ εργων νομου διοτι ου δικαιωθησεται εξ εργων νομου πασα σαρξ | 
|---|---|
| 17 “But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is Christ therefore a minister of sin? Certainly not!  | 17 ει δε ζητουντες δικαιωθηναι εν χριστω ευρεθημεν και αυτοι αμαρτωλοι αρα χριστος αμαρτιας διακονος μη γενοιτο | 
|---|---|
| 18 For if I build again those things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor. | 18 ει γαρ α κατελυσα ταυτα παλιν οικοδομω παραβατην εμαυτον συνιστημι |
|---|---|
|  19 For I through the law died to the law that I might live to God.  |19 εγω γαρ δια νομου νομω απεθανον ινα θεω ζησω |
|---|---|
| 20 I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me.   |20 χριστω συνεσταυρωμαι ζω δε ουκετι εγω ζη δε εν εμοι χριστος ο δε νυν ζω εν σαρκι εν πιστει ζω τη του υιου του θεου του αγαπησαντος με και παραδοντος εαυτον υπερ εμου |

From reading this passage we can understand that the faith being talked about i sof the 1st and 3rd definitions. We know this immediately in verse 16 because it says that "we might be justified (made right in the original) by faith in Christ-"
Verse 17 expounds upon this notion of our "works" decreasing ourselves and increasing Christ. This also cross references well to 1 John 2: 4 
Whoever says “I know him” but does not keep his commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in him. 
In other words, it appears that verse 17 is telling us that we cannot just "believe" or "have faith," rather we must do something and change who we are. 
Verse 18 backs this up where St. Paul states that building your past up causes one to become a transgressor. 
Verse 19 reiterates the point that the Judaic culture/law cannot save anyone. 
Finally, verse 20 nails this point that it is no longer I who live but Christ. In other words, it is through the diminishing will of St. Paul that he comes closer to the Lord and Salvation. 
Recall the Lord's Prayer, "not my will but thine be done."

What this implies to me is that belief is not enough. You must be faithful to Christ. In John 14:21, Christ states the following. 
He who has My commandments and keeps them, it is he who loves Me. And he who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and manifest Myself to him.
Having faith/being faithful to the Lord is more than an intellectual assent to a set of propositions. It is a total lifestyle change and commitment to a person and a set of commandments. 

I could go on and on and on, analyzing verse after verse, however, I think that it is clear that the words of St. James and St. Paul do not conflict when we do not rely on translations and rather go to the Greek. 

### Reason 3.5: But what about Hebrews 11:1 
Hebrews 11:1 
Now faith (πίστις) is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. 

This seems compelling to the Protestant who appeals to the second definition of πίστις. However, it does not seem to be the case that the persuasion of a proposition is the meaning in use here. Reading on through the rest of Hebrews 11, we can see that all of the examples of faith, are manifested through things that were done. For example, 
1. By faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, 
2. By faith Enoch was taken away so that he did not see death, “and was not found, because God had taken him”; for before he was taken he had this testimony, that he pleased God
3. By faith Noah, being divinely warned of things not yet seen, moved with godly fear, 
4. By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to the place which he would receive as an inheritance. And he went out, not knowing where he was going.
etc. etc. 

On and on the list goes. Each and every single example involves the figure **doing something or changing their life**. Enoch was not taken into heaven because he mentally assented to the arguments of God really hard, rather he pleased Him and was brought up. The same can be said for Abraham. His faith pleased God because he left his home and went, quite literally, God knows where. 

## Reason 4: The Separation of the Sheep and the Goats 

Now, I would like to look at two particular passages that can be quite chilling to remember. 

Revelation 20:12
And I saw the dead, small and great, standing before [c]God, and books were opened. And another book was opened, which is the Book of Life. And the dead were judged according to their **works**, by the things which were written in the books. 

I think that this passage is pretty straightforward. You will not be asked about your beliefs on the day of the Final Judgement, but it appears from this work that you will be judged on what you did. 

Let us consult another passage that is incredibly relevant to this topic. 

[Matthew 25:31-46](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2025&version=ESV;TR1550)

This passage, I think, is particularly useful for determining how we know that it is our works through our faithfulness that will save us. I linked it due to the length. In this passage, we once again see the Final Judgement where Christ separates the "sheep" from the "goats." Since we are all made in the Image of God and any honor/dishonor passed on to the Image of God is passed onto God himself, it therefore makes perfect sense, that whenever we see someone in need of any kind and neglect them, we are neglecting Christ. 

Since we are all made in the "Icon" of God, compare the teaching of the above passage in Matthew to this decision made by the Seventh Ecumenical Council at Nicaea II. 

"Moreover, that the images of Christ, of the Virgin Mother of God and of
the other Saints, are to be bad and retained particularly in temples, and
that due honor and veneration are to be awarded them; not that any
divinity or virtue is believed to be in them, on account of which they are to
be worshipped; or that anything is to be asked of them; or that confidence
is to be reposed in images, as was of old done by Gentiles, who placed
their hope in idols; but because the honor which is shown unto them is
referred to the prototypes which they represent; in such wise that by the
images which we kiss, and before which we uncover the head, and
prostrate ourselves, we adore Christ, and venerate the Saints, whose
similitude they bear. And this, by the decrees of councils, and especially
of the second synod of Nicaea, has been ordained against the opponents of
images." 

### Conclusion 

Pleae consult with a priest about this. Internet Christianity is not what will save you, but living a Godly life in a community might be a better way to honoring the icons of God all around you. It is only through honoring the Lord through actions and faithfulness, that you will be saved. A mental assent to the existence of God is insufficient. 
Having faith alone is insufficient. Theosis comes about through works done in faithfulness. 

Christ is risen from the dead, trampling down death by death, and upon those in the tombs bestowing life,
