title: Your job does not define you.

# Your job does not define you 

Within the last month, I made a difficult decision. That decision was to quit one of my jobs, (I have two at the moment of writing this). In this post, I will elaborate a little on why modern work is not what you should identify with. 

Before proceeding with reading though, please understand that you cannot just up and quit your job, especially if you have a family. Providing for your family comes first. However, I think that there are times where if you are financially secure enough, it is a completely justified decision. Nonetheless, 
THIS IS NOT ADVICE. 

Now to proceed. 

## Life is finite 

With most jobs in the United States and the rest of the developed world, many people work an hourly wage. This is obvious. What is not obvious is that it is an economic exchange of your life for money. 
Think of the exchange you make to earn a paycheck in this position. You exchange X hours of life for X dollars. This includes all of the opportunities that come from sacrificing that time. This is an incredible sacrifice on the part of the worker. 
Considering this, remember that time is finite and can never be recovered. Money is finite and can be recovered. 


## You are an equal participant in the process of your paycheck 

All too often, it is common for people to think that they "work" for someone/some company, etc. This is only true if the employee allows it to be true. A better way for the worker to consider this situation is to perceive him/herself as a salesman of their own time and skills. Those hours and skills are exchanged for an agreed price on a recurring basis, i.e. every pay period. If the employer is not satisfied with the performance of the employee, we know that this worker can be fired, however, consider the inverse. The worker/employee can also fire their employer if the employer does not live up to the worker's standards. 

Employees employ their employers as much as their employers employ them. 
Take a moment to understand that. I know it must sound strange. 

## How you live and who you love defines you 

Now that we have seen how your job is essentially a recurring exchange of time and skill, we understand that it does not define you any more than the product that someone sells. 
What does define you is how you live your life and who/what you love. This can involve your work, i.e. ethics and industriousness, however, it filters beyond that. Are you part of a community? Do you have a hobby or waste your time chronically online? Are you learning a new skill such as a foreign language, coding, or musical instrument? These are the types of things that define people. 
For example, I would say that I am defined as an Orthodox Christian and a member of a parish, a husband, a lifelong learner, language lover, nature lover, and someone who is constantly looking for ways to get better. 
In my opinion, this is a much better way to look at myself than as a lifeguard or as an adjunct instructor. I would invite the reader to reflect on the previous questions and my statement of how I am defined. 

Remember that you are amazing. You only have to act on it. People who do not act on their amazing potential, are not amazing.
