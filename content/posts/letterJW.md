title: A letter to a Jehovah's Witness
---

# Intro 

Yesterday, I checked the mail and to my surprise received a hand written letter from a Jehovah's witness(JW). Since it was hand written and some time had been put into sending a letter directly to myself, I decided to write back. This letter was an invitation to worship with the JWs and my response is an explanation of why I will never worship with them. 

In this letter, I explain the importance of the Nicene Creed, the Trinity, and the importance of the History of the Church. I hope that you can get something out of it. 

## The letter 

Dear JW, 


I want to thank you for the kind letter that you sent to me and my family. I am certainly impressed by the effort that you went to in order to send a letter to my apartment. This is why I am choosing to respond.

Please understand that the following is not to insult you or your faith. Rather, as you have taken the time out of love to invite me to the Faith, allow me to explain where the Jehovah’s Witnesses have erred. The importance of Ortho(correct)doxy(teaching) impacts the way we act in the world. The way the Universal, Orthodox, and Apostolic Church teaches is contrary to the Jehovah’s witnesses. 

Because of this, neither I nor my family will be attending any worship services of the “Jehovah’s” Witnesses. I will explain why this is the case in several reasons below. 

1. In your letter you describe the influence of Scripture and prophecy but nothing of the Church. How can I know that the “Jehovah’s” witnesses truly form part of the Church of Christ? Anyone can make Scripture say what they want to when it is taken out of context. How can I know that you are not doing this when your appeals to your Church have made no reference to its history since Christ?

2. “Jehovah” is not strictly speaking God’s name. This form of the Tetragrammaton (theological term for referring to the name of God) is an Anglicized version of a Latinization of a Hebrew word, whose vowels we no longer have.
Furthermore, for placing such emphasis on this name, you would know that it has not been edited out of Scripture, but rather Jewish culture views the name of God with so much reverence that it is not acceptable to say it except under very specific and holy circumstances. This is why many Bibles use Lord, a translation of the Hebrew Adonai, a placeholder of respect for the name of God. 
For a denomination that stresses this point so much, it calls your theology into question for me that its foundation is so flimsy.

3. The Christological stance of your denomination was revealed to be false by the Holy Spirit at the Council of Nicaea.

The Arian (named after the bishop Arius, nothing to do with Nazis) Controversy that occurred shortly after the legalization of Christianity in the Roman Empire led to a dispute over whether Jesus was ομoουσιον with God the Father. Ουσια is a Greek word that can be roughly translated to as essence.  
Part of the Church sided with Arius and another with St. Athanasius. 

The position of St. Athanasius was that Jesus is ομο (same) ουσιον (essence) with God the Father. Under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, this council of the Bishops of the Church at that time and the Saint Emperor Constantine were led to the position of Athanasius. The Conclusion to this is summed up in what is called the Nicene Creed. I will be adding it to the end of this letter. (Please note that the section of the Holy Spirit was revealed at a subsequent council). 

Please refer to the first chapter of John for this, 
“In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and was God.”
1 Timothy 3:16
John 14:9
1 John 1



4. I would rather be killed than deny the Trinity

The importance of the Creed details WHO God is beyond just his name. This is not to say that his name is unimportant, but as you know, terms can mean different things to different people. Therefore, in order to avoid confusion with Arians or Pneumatomachians (those who deny the divinity of the Holy Spirit who is also of the same essence with God the Father), the Nicene Creed defines and lays out plainly who the God of Christians is. 

Frankly, if you deny this revelation, you are not a Christian. I will include scriptural references to the Holy Trinity within Scripture alongside the Nicene Creed as well. Please note that the Trinity is indeed present in scripture, but not in the Greek philosophical language that modern Christians use to identify the Trinity. 

5. Why this matters or your vision of Heaven vs Theosis as described by St. Athanasius

The reason why this Doctrine matters is because it defines what Salvation is to the Christian. Christ did not die so that we can go to a spatial realm of eternal pleasures. Rather what we see in Scripture (I.e 2 Peter Chapter 1) is that we become partakers of the Divine Nature. 

This Council of Nicaea also laid out that Christ is equally God and equally Man. 

Consult John 1 again. “The Word became flesh.” This flesh was taken from the Virgin Mary, meaning that Christ is of the same substance as us as well as with the Father. 

What this does is raise up Human Nature to Divinity so that we too can fulfill what St. Peter writes and become “partakers of the Divine Nature.” This is what Heaven means. 1 John 5 also states that we have been given eternal life, not necessarily a place where things are literally paradise in the sense of a Paradise on Earth. I affirm the scriptures from Revelation that you cite, however, these are not necessarily literal. 

I would recommend reading the essay by St. Athanasius, On the Incarnation. It is not long, around 50 pages. 

To quote him though, “God became man, so that man might become God.”

Please see

2 Peter 1
John 14
1 Corinthians 14
John 6

6. And I say also unto thee, that thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. Matthew 17:18

Jehovah’s Witnesses state that the Church became apostate after the time of the apostles. I would ask you to explain this in light of the previous verse as well as the following. 

Romans 9:27
Romans 11:15
Revelation 12:17

The idea of the Great Apostasy is simply conspiratorial and handwaves away the entirety of Church History. I invite you to investigate early Church writers such as St. Justin Martyr, St. Ignatius of Antioch, St. Clement of Rome, etc. Upon researching such figures, I hope you come to the conclusion the idea of a great Apostasy is simply absurd. 


7. Failed predictions on the Second Coming of Christ

I am sure you are familiar with these arguments and I do not feel the need to address them thoroughly. “No man knows the day nor the hour.”


Conclusion:

In Conclusion, I would invite you to look into the history of the Early Church, going to the foundation of the Jehovah’s Witnesses to the Protestant Reformation, to the Great Schism to the Councils, and then finally back to scripture. It is only through the light of the Revelation of the Holy Spirit in history and the Church that we can understand what Scripture is telling us. 

In the West, Doctrine has been greatly obscured and distorted since the days of the Great Schism in 1054 when the Western Church willingly broke away from its Eastern brothers. Because of this reason, I advise you to become acquainted with Christian teaching and literature from places such as Syria, Greece, Egypt, Russia, etc. There you will find quite a different version of Christianity from anything Protestant or Roman Catholic. 

It is only through prayer and redirecting our minds and hearts to God that we can be saved and become like His only begotten consubstantial Son and His Holy All Good and Life Creating Spirit. 

Christ is risen, 


Sincerely


The Nicene Creed
I believe in one God, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible.
And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, begotten of the Father before all ages; Light of Light, true God of true God, begotten, not created, of one essence with the Father through Whom all things were made. Who for us men and for our salvation came down from heaven and was incarnate of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary and became man. He was crucified for us under Pontius Pilate, and suffered and was buried; And He rose on the third day, according to the Scriptures. He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father; And He will come again with glory to judge the living and dead. His kingdom shall have no end.
And in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the Creator of life, Who proceeds from the Father, Who together with the Father and the Son is worshipped and glorified, Who spoke through the prophets.
In one, holy, universal, and apostolic Church.
I confess one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.
I look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the age to come.
