# Introduction to the idea of Linguistic Cases

## What is case in Linguistics 

In English, we have what can be considered a rather rigid structure to our sentences which briefly can be described as SVO, Subject, Verb, Object. However, this structure can be rather limiting in some circumstances. Because of this, a large number of the languages in the world use what is called a grammatical case. These grammatical cases determine the role of a noun in the sentence. For example, in English the following sentences mean the opposite things. 

The man loves the woman. 
The woman loves the man. 

In Greek however, the case is what determines the role of the noun. Lets take a look at what is going on in the sentences below.  

1. Ό ανθροπος αγαπει την γυνην. 
   Ho anthropos agapi tin ginin. 
   The man loves the woman.
   
2. Ή γυνη αγαπει τον ανθροπον. 
   Hi gini agapi ton anthropon. 
   The woman loves the man. 

3. Τον ανθροπον αγαπει ή γυνη. 
   Ton anthropon agapi hi gini.  
   The man loves the woman. 
   
4. Την γυνην αγαπει ό ανθροπος. 
   Tin ginin agapi ho anthropos.  
   The woman loves the man. 
   
In the Greek sentences, the nouns are composed of two parts, a root and a case suffix. In English, we generally only use plural suffixes like this for our nouns, i.e. cat -> cats. However in Greek, we can see that the noun takes a suffix for its role in the sentence. For example, the word "Man" in Greek is ανθροπος. In 1. and 2. the man loves the woman and the noun for man ends in -os/ος. However, in 3 and 4 the ending changes to -ον/on. The change to the end of the noun indicates how its role in the sentence has changed from what is called the Nominative Case, the subject, to the Accusative Case, the object. 

In Greek there are also an additional two cases, the Genitive and the Dative. We will be going over all four, as well as a fifth, the Vocative. However, lets start by further contrasting the Nominative and the Accusative. 

## Nominative and Accusative 

The nominative case of a noun indicates that it is the actor or agent in a sentence. In our previous example with Greek, we can see that the noun for man takes a nominative form of ανθροπος. Meanwhile, the accusative case indicates the noun that is being acted upon, i.e. ανθροπον. 

The nominative case will always indicate the actor of the sentence. However, the accusative can sometimes indicate motion towards. For example, lets take a look at the sentence below. 

5. Ό Χριστος πεμπει τον Πετρον εις την Ρομην. 
   Ho Christos pempi ton Petron tin Romin. 
   The Christ(Nom) sends Peter(Acc) to Rome(Acc). 

In 5. we can see that the Christ is the subject who sends the direct object, Peter, to Rome, as in the direction towards. This sentence exemplifies the dual role that the Accusative can have because Peter is experiencing the action of Christ sending him and Rome is the object to which he is being sent. 

## Genitive 

The Genitive case indicates a relationship between two nouns and is roughly equivalent to the prepositions 'of' and 'from' in English. Once again, the best way to see it is in action and through example. 

6. Ό Χριστος ει ό Υιος του Θεου. 
   Ho Christos i ho ios tu theu. 
   The Christ(Νom) is the Son(Νοm) of God(Gen). 
   
In this example, we observe that there is a relationship between God and the Christ, i.e. the relationship with the Son is with the God. 

The Genitive can also be used to explain a handful of other things such as motion away from. In the example below, we can see this use in the instance of Christ being taken down from the Cross. 

7. Απο του σταυρου, αυτον λαμβανουσι. 
   Apo tu stawru, afton lambanusi. 
   From the Cross(Gen), him(Acc) they take. 
   
## Dative 

Finally we have the Dative case. While the Accusative and the Genetive are often used for meanings of movement towards or away, the Dative tends to take on the role for other types of movement and can be thought of as the indirect object. Roughly, the Dative will tend to correspond to the preposition 'to' in English. 

8. Δοξα Πατρι και Υιω και Άγιω Πνευματι. 
   Doxa Patri ke Io ke Hagio Pnevmati. 
   Glory Father(Dat) and Son(Dat) and Holy(Dat) Spirit(Dat) 
   
In this example, we can see that Glory is being sent to the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. One should be able to notice the change in the word Υιος as we have gone through these examples. Also of note is that the Dative case removes the necessity for the preposition 'to' in Greek. 

## Vocative 

Last but not least of the cases in Greek, we have the Vocative. The Vocative does exactly what it sounds like it does. It invokes something or someone. This case is often identical to the Nominative, however, many languages, like Greek, have some nouns that do indeed change form when being used for this purpose. For example, while man in Greek is ανθροπος, the phrase 'O man' is ανθροπε. The change in the ending is merely to indicate that the noun is being used to invoke the referent. 

## Number 

Finally, most languages that use a case system will also change the suffixes on the end when the noun is plural. Some languages with cases, such as Sanskrit, even add a Dual for only two things at a time. To get a glimpse at this, lets observe the full case declension, i.e. pattern, for the word ανθροπος with the root of 

#### Root: Ανθροπ-

| Case | Singular | Plural |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Nominative | ανθροπος, anthropos | ανθροποι, anthropi | 
| Accusative | ανθροπον, anthropon | ανθροπους, anthropus | 
| Genitive | ανθροπου, anthropu | ανθροπων, anthropón |
| Dative | ανθροπω, anthropó | ανθροποις, anthropis | 
| Vocative | ανθροπε, anthrope | ανθροποι, anthropoi |

In the case of Greek, a gendered language, there are actually a variety of paradigms/patters like this for different nouns, another feature common to case languages. However, This should help you get the idea for how the case changes throughout

## Conclusion 

In conclusion, case is a common linguistic phenomenon found in a large amount of the languages of the world. Five of the most common cases are the Nominative, the Accusative, the Genitive, the Dative, and the Vocative. These cases are those used in Greek, however, other languages such as Sanskrit and Finnish, among others, can have more cases that cover roles that we did not cover in this blog post.
