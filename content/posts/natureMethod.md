# The Nature Method is the best way to learn languages 

## What is the Nature Method? 

The Nature Method is a now mostly defunct method of learning languages that has gradually lost popularity since the 1950s, with the exception of Latin courses and classes. However, this method used to be one of, if not the most popular method for language learning. 

Before the 1950s, people did not have a million different commercialized ways for learning languages. Instead, the prominent method for language learning was what is called the Nature Method. If you are familiar with Krashen's theories of Comprehensible Input, then you should be familiar with the Nature Method. They essentially boil down to the same idea, exposing the learner to the language in genuine and piecemeal portions. 

For example, the first chapter of one of my favorite Nature Method books, Poco a Poco by Guillermo Franklin Hall, begins like this 

El elefante es un animal. ¿Qué es el elefante?
- Es un animal. 

The book then proceeds to introduce the question and answer structure for introducing what an object is and asking for its identity from the native speaker with accompanying pictures. This method for language instruction is inherently superior to modern products like Duolingo. In Duolingo, while picture and idea association is employed, it can be performed mindlessly, whereas in the Nature Method, engagement with the text is key. 

One might observe the above example and suggest that it only functions with languages that have high amounts of cognates. In this case, I would like to direct the skeptic to Kenneth Brooks, Russian through reading. The following example is accompanied by a map of the USSR after the student has learned the alphabet. 

Вот карта. Это карта СССР. Тут столица СССР, Москва. 

While карта definitely represents a cognate, столица does not. Imagine the map now with its key. You see a special icon that shows the столица and Moscow has this icon. The connection between Moscow and Москва should be either known or obvious to the student of Russian. Combining these instances, the student can easily come to the conclusion that столица means capital and that furthermore, Тут means an indication of the presence of something, i.e. voilá. 

This type of immediate connection between ideas, concepts, and visual imagery trumps the traditional method of either Duolingo or Grammar Translation. 

## Why is this method not more popular 

Ultimately the answer to the above question remains a mystery both to me and to the world. Many of the publishers of these books are either no longer printing or have gone to the more innovative Grammar Translation or Duolingo like approaches, such as Berlitz if I am not wrong. However, I have an idea.  
With the rise of capitalism in the post World War 2 period, the idea of books that genuinely taught languages did not make sense to publishers anymore. Why sell books that efficiently intuit the grammar while creating vocabulary associations based off intuition and imagery when the student can buy tiered level books on grammar and translation instead? The answer was obvious and it was just good business. Furthermore, while a high level of mindful engagement is necessary for the nature method to work, this is not the case for Grammar Translation necessarily. The immediate translation of Γεια σας to hello appeals to the Anglo-American consumers of language learning products in the United States because most of them have never had to genuinely try and communicate with someone who does not know English. Therefore my proposed explanation is that good business, culture, and some good ol' fashioned American laziness are behind the rise of the current market of Language Learning products. 

After the popularity of Krashen, and his rediscovery of the Nature Method, we have seen a boom in Duolingo like products. However, as I specified before, these products lack the intentional and mindful engagement required for true concept mastery. 

## Where can you get Nature Method books? 

You can get them online of course! And almost all of them are completely free on archive.org or other sites. Fortunately, you can find a list of them and where to get them [here](https://blog.nina.coffee/2018/08/27/all_nature_method_books.html). You can also find audio for some of these books on youtube, often from Ayan Academy. 

## Conclusion 

If you are wanting to learn a new language, I recommend trying out the Nature Method. Combing this method with tools like Lingq or Learn with Texts is an excellent idea. I would also recommend that you combine this technique with long periods of passive listening immersion. 

Keep in mind as well, that language learning is a difficult and long process, even with the best methods. While the Nature Method is excellent, it will not magically grant you the ability to blow your Italian friends away with the Dolce Vita with which you learn. It will be more like a Russian winter through reading. The Nature Method is just a really good coat.
