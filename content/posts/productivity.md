# How to get sh** done 

I recently had a chat with a friend on how to be more productive and thought that I would turn my advice into a blog post on the subject. The following points will be mostly geared to people who want to do more with their time and learn new things, i.e. get more done at work, learn a new language, play a musical instrument, code, etc. 

## Set reasonable goals 

Whenever someone starts a new hobby, project, etc, it is important to keep expectations realistic. This is something that I mentioned in my post on language learning. For example, if you live in a small town in Kansas and want to learn a new language, you are realistically limited by your options. In that situation, Spanish will always be a better choice than Japanese, unless that is the only thing that piques learning interest. While the internet does mitigate this some, I believe it is overrated. 

With that in mind, your goals should be S.M.A.R.T. The acronym is spelled out below with examples from language learning. 

Goals should be 
- Specific (which language, where to use, why that language)
- Measurable (achieve B1 fluency on the CEFR scale)
- Actionable (reading and writing a little everyday)
- Relevant (doing things in the language, not just things related to its culture)
- Time bound (compare the measurable level with the FSI time rankings for language)

These criteria, when followed, help us to achieve things that can actually be done. Always find ways to try and act on these questions when setting out on a new goal. 

## Divide tasks up into smaller tasks 

Once again in the case of learning a language, this is impossible. Nobody can learn Greek, Swahili, Russian, etc. It is just not possible. What can be done, however, is to learn the conjugation for the first group of Greek verbs in the present tense. Anyone can do that. Once that is done, add the second group of verbs. Before you know it, a language has been learned. 

Do not be overly ambitious in the goals that you set for yourself. This means limiting yourself in what you plan to accomplish. Limit the number of things in a day. How many? That is a question that every individual needs to assess on their own. However, in my opinion, less is more. Quality often trumps quantity when it comes to being productive. What is worth more, one really good knife that you spent some money on, or a dollar tree pocket-knife? The answer is obvious. 

That being said, do be somewhat ambitious. If the goal is too low, you will never get anywhere, get bored, and quit whatever it is you are trying to do. If you shoot for the moon and fail, you will land among the stars. 

## Make a to-do list 

This is easily the most actionable thing you can do once you have assessed what your goals are. 
Simply get a piece of paper and write down what you need to get done on a given day. As you do the things written on the paper, cross them out. When I was in my M.A. program I did this everyday, and nothing was more satisfying than seeing my to do list with all items crossed out. 
This one small thing will make your goals, S.M.A.R.T. on a daily basis. 

## Discipline is a system, not willpower 

In American and Western Society, we often think that we can do anything as individuals. Anything you want to do can be accomplished with enough willpower and desire. 
This is false. 
People who are disciplined are not magically capable of doing things better than others, rather they are the products of their environments which push them to do more things. This means that **discipline is a system.** You are not capable of doing anything without systems in place to help you do them. The system does not have to be elaborate, even the to-do list goes very far and is often more than enough. 
Some ways in which you can implement a system of discipline are to 

1. Work/study/etc. in a specific location
2. Work/study/etc. at a specific time, every day/week
3. Use ambient music while working. This can classically condition you into a more productive state
4. Get enough sleep. This is actually better than ramping up your work/study
5. Get enough exercise. A healthy body = a healthy mind 
6. Do the minimum to trick yourself into it. I.e. If you struggle with working out, tell yourself you are going to go to the gym and that you do not have to work out. Once there, you will probably do it anyway. 
7. Force yourself to do something, even when you do not feel like it. There is power in patterns 
8. Use a Reminder app on your phone
9. Take breaks 
10. Set yourself a theme 

If for some reason, you have a hard time with any of the above, lean into the others

## Themes 

If you have not seen CGP Grey's [video on yearly themes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVGuFdX5guE), click the link and watch it. I am not exaggerating when I say that this idea changed my life. 

The theme is a way of setting yourself a fail-avoidant system in which you can constantly be motivated to continue towards your goals. If you want to learn a musical instrument, then why not year of music? Whenever you are presented with the chance to play on your phone at home or the instrument, the theme can help you pick. Or if you are learning a language, use Anki while in line at the store instead of reading XterBookGramChatTube. 

Please note too, that this does not have to be a year. It can be 6 months, 3 months, etc. As long as you set the theme and let it guide you, that is what matters. 

I will leave you to watch the video instead of explaining further. Grey does a much better idea expounding on this idea than I do. 

## Avoid personal comparison at all cost 

Comparing yourself to other people is often the worst thing that you can do. 
When I used to swim competitively as a kid, the coaches would always tell me to race against myself. It was not about having a better time than the guy in the lane next to me, but about beating the previous time. 
This same principle applies in most areas in life. If you are learning a language, and the only thing you do in a day is learn a single word, that is success. If you are learning the piano and you force yourself to play even a little bit, that is success. If you are trying to improve your company's profit margin and you do so by only one dollar, success! 

Someone once told me that if you want to feel bad about your skills in something, look up "North Korean kid does X" on YouTube. The North Korean kid will always be better. However, you are not the North Korean kid. You do things with your life besides Calculus or playing classical music for 16 hours a day. We do not know the stories of those near us or how they have the abilities that they have. Be kind to yourself. 

## Prayer (or Meditation) 

Finally, I would like to add that prayer is often really useful for getting things done. Now, I do not mean that you ask Jesus to solve your problems like He were Santa Claus. Rather, in Meditative prayer, you center yourself on what really matters. This is particularly helpful when you are anxious or frustrated over not reaching your goals. I would recommend slow recitation of the Jesus prayer. 

Other people have used and claimed that meditation works fine as well. Whatever the case may be, these two tools are indispensable when it comes to centering yourself so that you can get things done. 

## Conclusion 

At the end of the day, the best way to be more productive is to have specific, measurable, actionable, relevant, and time-bound goals. Once you have these, be kind to yourself and avoid comparisons. Know that any amount of success, however, small, is still success. Make sure to center yourself and finally, set a theme for a reasonable amount of time in your life. 

I will be leaving some links to relevant resources on productivity if you are interested in them. 

Glory to Jesus Christ
