# Why Protestants should accept the Book of Tobit

For those unfamiliar with the Book of Tobit, I will write a quick summary of it here. 

Long ago in Nineveh there lived a man named Tobit. One day he became blind from a bird leaving excrement in his eyes. Unable to work his wife turns to stealing a goat which causes him great distress. However, one day he remembers an investment he has made with a family member in Media, somewhere in modern Iran likely. He sends his son Tobias out to find a travelling companion to go with him to Media and collect the investment. This companion turns out to be the Archangel Raphael in disguise. 

Meanwhile in Media, Raguel, the holder of Tobit's investment, has a daughter who is plagued by the demon Asmodeus. This demon has killed her last seven husbands on their wedding night consistently. 

Tobias and Rafael travel to Media along the Tigris when a great and giant fish leaps out of the river towards them. Raphael slays the fish and instructs Tobit to keep the bile, heart, and liver of the fish. 

When they arrive in Media, Raguel opens his arms widely to the two and Tobias falls in love with Sara, the daughter of Raguel. However, he is scared to marry her because she is plagued by the demon. Raphael instructs Tobias to burn the heart and liver of the fish which creates a beautiful smell. This smell offends the demon. Raphael then exorcises the demon far away, liberating Sara and her family. 

The family of Raguel and Sara inherit everything they have to Tobias and the two go back to Nineveh to report the good news to Tobit. There Raphael uses the bile from the fish to cure Tobit of his blindness and reveals himself to the two and the story ends with the wedding feast of Tobias and Sara and Tobit's praises to God. 

# Argument in favor of the book  

For centuries upon centuries up until the time of Christ, the Old Testament was based upon a translation of the Bible, not the Hebrew originals, into Greek. This translation is what we now call the Septuagint, so called because it was translated by 70 (sept, as in siete) scribes in Alexandria, Egypt. The Septuagint was the Bible that Christ would have used and the Masoretes, whose Hebrew texts the Protestant Old Testament is based on, would not come along for another few centuries. 

Because of this, should we not immediately look to the translation and text that Christ Himself would have been familiar with? This question is crucial due to the Septuagint's inclusion of what have been called the Apocrypha, Greek for hidden. These books fill in gaps between Malachi and Matthew. Furthermore, we can deduce and induce from the writings of Paul to Timothy in 2 Tim 3:16 that the Apocrypha was included into his reference of scripture being God breathed because the Septuagint would have been the most circulated version of Scripture at the time. 

One of these books is Tobit and here I will explain why I think that Protestants should include it as Canon. 

If you follow this [link](https://www.scripturecatholic.com/deuterocanonical-books-new-testament/) you will find a number of times that Tobit is referenced in the New Testament. I mention this because, one of the main arguments that Protestants give against the Apocrypha is that it is never mentioned nor referenced by Christ or the Apostles. This argument is outright false. For example, the Book of Jude quotes an even more obscure book, Enoch. This citation is also uncontroversial among Biblical scholars. The above link also mentions Tobit several times. 

Additionally, the Council of Rome in 382, which decided which books would be part of Scriptural canon, decided that Tobit and other apocryphal works should be included. With the exception of Jerome, I am not aware of any major criticisms of this inclusion from any form of OrthoChristianity within the next 1100 years.

Finally, lets analyze the themes of the Book of Tobit and parallels with the Gospels.  

1. First, the Father sent Christ down to Earth just as Tobit sent Tobias to Nineveh, resulting in the salvation of his family from poverty

2. While in Media Raphael exorcises the demon, paralleling the various exorcisms performed by Christ and the demittance/remittance of sins. I use these words because the Vulgate uses dimittere/remittere for the verb forgive, meaning "to send away". This is what Raphael does with Asmodeus. 

3. The symbolism of Christ and the Fish is obvious both to modern and ancient Christians, i.e. the Great and Original Fisher of men. It is from a Fish that the demon is offended and expelled and Tobit is cured of his blindness. 

4. Curing the blindness of Tobit alludes to the same miracle performed by Christ. 

5. The book ends in the same way that the New Testament ends. Here Tobias would represent Christ, i.e. the Son of God come to Earth, and Sara represents the Church, liberated from Sin by the Son of God. Albeit, in this story indirectly since Tobias is not the Son of God.   

I find these reasons sufficiently compelling and complete that they should warrant the Book of Tobit a place alongside the other great books of the Old Testament. Furthermore, this book helps us to understand angelology and demonology, prophecies for Christ that were not Messianic per se but undoubtedly foretold His coming, and Theosis with the Divine. 

I hope that you have learned something from this post, whether you agree with me or disagree.

Have a great day wherever you are and pax tibi
