## The false dichotomy of good and bad people

Often in my interactions with secular people I am confronted with the following phrase

"You don't need religion to be a good person."

In all honesty, I have to submit and agree with this statement. However, I want to clarify my agreement.

I believe that what is being proposed by the secular person is that there is a state in which a person is good through the absence of certain tainting actions, among which are murder, theft, negligence of caring for a family, etc. Things that all humans would agree are wrong. We know what these are, actions that extremely affect the wellbeing of another human. I also believe that the secular person is proposing that people who do perform such actions would fall into the category of "bad person." For example, the secular American world feels very comfortable labeling Vladimir Putin as a bad person for his war against Ukraine.

This line of reasoning appears to be ontologically, that is in essence or mode of being, false. In the proposal of good people and bad people, we are offered the position that people are either good or bad. This is called a False Dichotomy. False dichotomies are characterized by the position of offering two choices when multiple are available. For example, overly patriotic republicans will say that or one speaks Spanish at home, or one hates the USA. This is demonstrably false. It is possible to speak Spanish at home and love the USA. Likewise, fanatic liberals will state that one either affirms gender affirming care for "transgenders" or hates "transgenders." Once again, it is demonstrably false that this is an either or situation. It is possible to care for someone without affirming their constructed identity.

This is all to say that we are constantly surrounded by False dichotomies, most notable of which is the good person fallacy, the false dichotomy of good and bad people. Therefore, I reject the proposal of good people on the grounds that I find it to be consistently a representation of a false dichotomy.

## We all have light and dark within us

For me, one of the most memorable scenes in the Harry Potter series comes from the following dialogue. In it, Harry perceives himself attacking a good friend and fatherly/uncle like figure to him. This is because he is linked to Voldemort and in a way feels his actions as if they were his own. This extends even to the instrument of attack, a snake that is linked by its soul to Voldemort. Due to this demonic connection, Harry begins to doubt his goodness to which his godfather, Sirius Black, gives us the following dialogue.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Harry Potter: Sirius, when I was... When I saw Mr. Weasley attacked, I wasn't just watching. I was the snake. And afterwards, in Dumbledore's office... there was a moment when I wanted to... This connection between me and Voldemort. What if the reason for it is that I am becoming more like him? I just feel so angry all the time. And what if, after everything that I've been through... something's gone wrong inside me? What if I'm becoming bad?

Sirius Black: I want you to listen to me very carefully, Harry. You're not a bad person. You're a very good person who bad things have happened to. You understand? Besides, the world isn't split into good people and Death Eaters. We've all got both light and dark inside of us. What matters is the part we choose to act on. That's who we really are.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I find that a much more accurate view of humanity is that we are, like Sirius says composed of both light and dark. This is reflected within the tradition of the Orthodox Church. On the one hand, we are all made in the image of God, and on the other we are all sick, i.e. sin. The Image of God in which we are made is not bad. It is good. Nonetheless, humanity's current state shows the image to be mistreated. It is covered with dirt and stained, etc.

## So what is religion for then?

As Sirius says, it is through our cooperation with either the light or the dark that determines who we are. However, we still have both the light and the darkness within us. This struggle against the darkness to cooperate with the light appears to be analogous to Theosis, the process of "becoming" God through cooperation. If only God is good, we must become one with Him to be good.

I also think that when Black states that Harry is a good person that bad things have happened to, this is a description of the Eastern view of how sin affects us. It is not a legal infraction or crime that we have committed, but rather a sickness that we have caught due to a circumstance outside of our control.

This oneness would be analogous to removing the stains and cleaning the dirt off of the Image of God while sin would be analogous to adding more dirt. Religion, and more particularly Orthodoxy, provides the tools necessary to clean the Image of God.

## But why do I need to follow a religion to be good? Can't I do it on my own?

In theory, I think the answer to this question is certainly, yes. St. Paul writes in his epistle to the Romans that "the requirements of this culture is written on their hearts." (Please note that I am choosing to translate νομος as culture as opposed to law). However, I would also say that it is unwise to attempt to do many things with a DIY approach. For example, Moses writes to us about the death of the sons of Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, who chose to worship God in their own way as opposed to what was revealed to the Church by God on Sinai. Because of this Nadab and Abihu were incinerated. Please note that this is not God being evil or mean. Rather his state of holiness is like a fire and the paths he provides us are means that allow us to come close to Him. For this reason, He mercifully gave man the Torah, and the Gospels, and the Psalms, etc, so that we could approach Him. If we choose not to follow that which has been revealed, we place ourselves at risk.

Now perhaps, the previous paragraph slants too Christian for the secular or New Age person. I can understand that. For this reason, consider the following. Religion provides the path beyond being a good person. The Virgin Mary and Most Holy Theotokos was not merely a good person. Neither were the prophets Moses, Samuel, Jonah, etc. Neither were St. Anthony of the Desert, St. Moses the Black, St. Mary of Egypt, etc. These people went to another level. Some in the New Age sphere would perhaps like to use the term "plane." Nonetheless, it is not possible to reach the heights that these people did without an established tradition. There have not been and nor will there ever be, New Age Saints. Even looking to the holy people of other religions, such as Buddha, Shankara, and Mohammad, these people were operating within a framework of tradition that had been passed on to them through generations.

To put this in terms of the secular proposal for good people previously mentioned, "you don't need religion to be a good person, but you do need it to be a holy person."

## What is holiness and what makes it different from goodness?

In Greek, the word for Holy is Αγιος. This word is a composite of Α-, not, and γη, earth, recognizable to modern people under the name of the earth goddess Gaia. In other words, holiness is something that has been set apart from the operations of this world.

In Latin, the word for Holy is Sanctus. Sanctus means something that is also set apart. Consider the related word Sacrificium, sacrifice. A sacrifice is a thing that has been set aside for a certain purpose, such as an offering to God or other entity. From this perspective, holiness refers to something that is separate for a specific purpose.

In English, Holy is a native word. According to etymonline, it ultimately derives from Proto-Germanic \*hailaga and from the Indo-European suffix \*kailo-, meaning intact and unviolated. Related words include health and whole. From here we can infer that holiness refers to something that has not been bothered and is whole and healthy. 

From this quick word study it does not take long for us to see that Holiness requires a greater degree of separation and wholeness to achieve. To return to our Sirius Black quote, it would be to fully act upon the light at all times in a state of separated health. After all, the darkness, sin, etc, that composes part of us is ultimately a sickness that impedes our ontological health. 

Given this perspective, we all are light and dark. Darkness is a defect or sickness within us. Acting upon or in a holy way allows us to set our light apart from the darkness and thereby become holy. All people are good people. Only some people are holy people.
