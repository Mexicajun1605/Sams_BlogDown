# 2024 Language Learning Goals 

2023 has taught me a lot about myself and what things I am interested in. One of these things has been language. What languages should I be studying? How hard and to what levels should I be studying them? Well based off the last year of dabbling in Irish, Thai, and a few other languages, I think that I have a good idea for what languages I want to really dedicate some time to in 2024. Those languages are Greek, Korean, and maybe Ukrainian. This last one is a maybe. 

# Greek X 2 

So like Donovan Nagel at the Mezzoguild before me, I think that I will go after Greek X 2. That means learning to read Ancient(Koine) Greek for the New Testament and Modern Greek for, well, actually speaking to people. Throughout this last year, I have felt the call to be in Church and read the Bible more. Naturally this made my language nerd self want to read the scriptures in the original, i.e. the Greek New Testament. 

This summer I sat down and went through all of Dr. David Alan Black's "Learn to read New Testament Greek." To my surprise, I can now read a lot of the Greek NT and get the general idea of what is going on. However, that is just it, the general idea. By the end of 2024, I want to be able to pick up the Greek NT, the Septuagint, or some other patristic writings and understand in detail what it is saying. 

Naturally, everyday, I will be reading and listening to a chapter from the Bible. Of course, this will have to be supplemented with some materials on Greek Linguistics. Hopefully, by the end of the year, I will have been able to accomplish my goal of fluent reading. 

In addition to the ancient variety, I think that Modern Greek not only complements it, but should improve it. One thing that irks me about a lot of audio recordings of the Greek New Testament is the poor reconstructed pronunciation that the readers have. This did not show up, however, when I listened to those made in Modern pronunciation.  

My plan with the modern idiom is to attain 300 hours of study. This will include time spent reading, writing, listening, and speaking. This means movies, music, conversation, etc. While I could use Learning with Texts, I have decided to go with Lingq to keep up with the statistics of this task, due to its great mobile app and just to make life generally easier. I also plan on going through at least 1 grammar book completely.

By the end of 2024, I want to be at a level in Greek that is roughly equivalent to B1. Who knows, perhaps I will get to go to Greece one of these days? 

# Korean 

My wife's life dream is to go to Korea. And thankfully, that dream will be fulfilled next year in the first two weeks of March. Unfortunately for me, I do not know Korean, and honestly, given the monster of a language it is, I do not expect great results before we go. 

Nonetheless, while we are there, I would like to be able to do some basic things like order food, ask someone about others and tell them about myself, and hold very basic conversations. Like Greek, I have also been studying Korean quite a bit this year as well. Hopefully, that will show when we get there. 

# Ukrainian

Out of an impulse on Lingq the other day, I signed up for the 1000 word challenge in Ukrainian. Since I have been attending a Church under the authority of the Ukrainian American Orthodox Church lately, I thought it would be worthwhile to learn more about Ukraine and the traditions that the Church has brought from that country. 

Like Korean, I am not expecting to come anywhere close to mastery of the language. However, I think that the 1000 word goal on Lingq, is more than achievable. In addition to that, perhaps I will go through a beginner textbook like "Teach Yourself" or "Colloquial". 

Perhaps, I will really enjoy this language and study it even more intensely, or perhaps it will push me towards Russian? Who knows?

## Conclusion 

I do not know why, but I thought that it would be interesting maybe for others to read about my thoughts on some of the language learning goals I have for next year. Like many things, these ideas and goals are subject to change depending on the circumstances. Despite that, wish me luck when the new year rings in!
