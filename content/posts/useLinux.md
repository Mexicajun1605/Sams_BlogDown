title: Why everyone should use Linux

#Why everyone should use Linux

Most of my posts recently have revolved around Theological matters or Philosophy but I wanted to write about something practical today. And that is why I think that everybody should learn how to use Linux and ditch Windows and Mac. 

At the end of this post, I will also suggest some distributions for the new Linux user, since not all versions of Linux are the same. 

##1. Privacy  

While it is probably common knowledge that Windows is not the best option for privacy, not everyone is aware of how much data Apple is collecting from its users. For more details on the specifics on how both of these platforms are taking advantage of you, check out [this article](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/privacy-macos-or-windows-we-asked-the-experts/) from Digital Trends. 
Linux distributions on the other hand, do not collect your data and send it to a centralized server in the middle of God knows where, San Francisco, or anywhere elese. Nonetheless, some distributions of Linux have received scrutiny for this type of behaviour as well, such as Ubuntu, but even then, the accusations of data collection are nowhere near what we know Microsoft and Apple are up to. 

Furthermore, Microsoft and Apple have closed source operating systems. This means that when someone uses their products, they have to have blind trust in the company and have been stripped of their rights to analyze and repair their rightly purchased products. Linux, however, is open sourced. This means that anyone with the patience or savoir-faire can manipulate, repair, or update their system however they see fit. With the exception of a scant few distributions this is universal in the Linux sphere. 
  
##2. Free

Second on our list and related to the first, is that Linux is free! That's right you do not have to pay to use any of the major Linux distributions. The reason why they are free is because the code used to create the OS is open, meaning anyone can just copy it and use it or modify it however they want. This does mean that the options available for Linux are super-abundant but that is overall a good thing. 

Microsoft and Apple lock us into their secret gardens with blindfolds over our eyes and do not expect us to be smart enough to configure or learn how to use our Operating Systems or hardware unless we have the most up to date version of their product. This means that we ultimately have to pay them over and over and over just to use the same products. This has become even more heinous in recent years due to the Subscription model that software has been trending towards. In other words, we are being robbed of our ownership over the products that we have rightly paid for, looking at you too Adobe btw. 

Even common office products, such as the equivalents to Word, Excel, Powerpoint, etc, that come bundled with most Linux distributions are free. You will never have to pay for using a Word Processor or a Spreadsheet or a Powerpoint Presentation. 

I can continue going on about the magic that is Open Source and how it has opened the door to freedom and ownership again, but lets move on to hardware.   

##3. Longer life for your tech  

Finally, not only do Microsoft and Apple rob us from truly owning our software, they go the extra mile and rob us of the ownership we have on our hardware! Since these companies insist on making us use the most up to date versions of their software and using more and more sophisticated algorithms and machine learning models to steal our data. I first started noticing this the first time Windows decided to eat up all of the CPU power that one of my computers was using back in 2020. 

Ultimately this theft of hardware is what convinced me to switch to Linux. On that computer that took 30 minutes to open Microsoft Word and was constantly dividing CPU power among hundreds if not thousands of useless tasks, it took less than one second to open LibreOffice Docs, the equivalent to Word, and my CPU processing levels returned to what they were like when I had just purchased the laptop. 

Furthermore, you get to choose how much power and how many processes your computer uses when you use Linux, unlike the Tech Giant OSes. 

#What distribution should I choose?

##Ubuntu
Possibly the most popular distribution of Linux of all time, Ubuntu is a constantly updated operating system supported by the Tech company canonical. It is very beginner friendly and where most people who start with Linux go to. It is what I started on and what I am writing this post on. 

There are tons of tutorials on starting off with Linux with Ubuntu, tons of support, an App store, a mobile version and more. Without a doubt this is the go to distribution for most newbies. 

However, some people have begun to criticize Ubuntu for data collection recently, however, Canonical makes this an option and is up front about this when installing the distribution on your computer. And, you can opt out of it entirely. Some people find this enough to discard Ubuntu as an option, however, since the choice is there and you can indeed choose not to share data, I think it still deserves a mention and a try (especially if you opt out). If you want to learn more about this, [omgubuntu](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2018/05/this-is-the-data-ubuntu-collects-about-your-system) has a great article on the topic. 

To download Ubuntu, go to [ubuntu.com](https://ubuntu.com/download)

##Linux Mint
The second major player comes in looking a lot more similar to Windows. It has a start bar, is updated regularly, and is superficially similar in many ways.

Linux Mint comes in three flavors, the basic Cinnamon with all the bells and whistles, the Mate flavor which is the most stable, and the XFCE flavor which is the lightest and best on older hardware. I have used both Cinnamon and XFCE and honestly, you cannot go wrong with either. 

The similarity to Windows' user interface is another big plus for a lot of people coming to Linux for the first time. And like Ubuntu, since this distribution has exploded in popularity, there is no shortage of tutorials or guides on how to get started up with using Linux Mint. 

You cannot go wrong with this classic choice.

##Lubuntu

Lubuntu is distribution very similar to Ubuntu and is derived from it in fact, meaning Lite Ubuntu. 

Lubuntu is a great distribution for older hardware, and while the current versions no longer support 64 bit systems, Lubuntu 18 is available on the [internet archive](https://archive.org/details/lubuntu-18.04.5-desktop-i386) as well for 32 bit systems from the 2000s, such as the Toshiba Satellite.

While it lacks some of the bells and whistles that Ubuntu has, I still have to recommend this version especially since it works great on older hardware. 

To download the latest version of Lubuntu, go to [lubuntu.me](https://lubuntu.me/)

#Conclusion

Despite why I think that Linux is for everyone, I can acknowledge that some people will just find it too intimidating, even though it is not. Nonetheless, I hope that you have gotten something from this post and if you do decide to use Linux, please use this tutorial from [howtogeek](https://www.howtogeek.com/693588/how-to-install-linux/) to get started. 
Using Linux has been a boon for me and I think that it will be for you too.
