# 2025 Language Learning Goals 

Defining my language learning goals for this year has been a bit more difficult than last year. I am once again afflicted by the shiny object syndrome. However, one of the reasons that I wrote that post was to make the goals public and thereby add a weight to the probability that I accomplish it. And I did. 

## Revisiting 2024's Language Learning Goals 

I successfully managed all of my language learning goals for 2024 in Greek, Korean, and Ukrainian. While my Greek has hit all of the measurable goals, I feel like I definitely want to make more of a commitment to this language than others perhaps. While I absolutely love Ukrainian, I struggle to justify it to myself as to why I should invest so much time in learning it. The same goes for Korean but double. Regarding the goals with those languages, I was able to answer follow up questions, do basic navigation, simple conversation, and a handful of other things with Korean while in South Korea. As for Ukrainian, I have learned the pleasanteries, some prayers, and some hymns. Overall 2024 has been a success. 

## 2025 Goals 

The goals for 2025 are going to be based around the SMART paradigm. This means they will be Specific, Measurable, Applicable, Realistic, and Time constrained. Hopefully using this framework will help me to achieve the goals. 

## Turkish 

Starting off with a language that I have had resistance toward in the past, Turkish is one of the langs that I will be studying in this first year. From the initial assesment I have, it seems like an easier version of Korean spoken by Muslims. 
I am choosing this language because I have been fortunate enough to schedule travel to Istanbul and see the Hagia Sophia. While in Turkey, I plan to accomplish similar goals to Korean, basic simple convos, order food with some follow up questions, basic navigation etc. The challenge here is that I will only be in Istanbul for 3 days. 
I plan to do this by working on Teach Yourself Turkish, Lingq, and Memrise.
This languages also excites me because I feel like it will teach me more about Islamic cultures, which I have also had a tremendous resistance to learn about due to my own upbringing and religious affiliation. However, Muslims are people too, and I feel like this will do a lot to expand my vision of their civilization. 
Finally, if you have not heard the band [Altin Gun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J5-57lRxAM), or Anatoliye Rock, it is a must listen. 

The SMART descriptions are as below

Specific: Basic convos, basic navigation, order food, cultural awareness
Measurable: 3000 words Lingq
Applicable: use while in Istanbul
Realistic: Will be challenging
Time constrained: Istanbul trip is in March

## Greek X 2 again

Once again, I will be studying both Ancient and Modern Greek. Regarding both, my work will also be centering more on grammar. So lets start with the Modern. 

### Modern 

Thanks to God, I will be travelling to Greece for a week this year, right before Istanbul. While in Greece, I want to be able to function completely normally, while acknowledging that I will make mistakes while speaking. 

### Ancient 

In the ancient language, I plan on branching outside the New Testament to include the Old and to also include the regular ancient Greek authors. While I will certainly branch off to Plato and Homer at some point this year, I am choosing Xenophon as my main author since he is widely considered more accessible to beginners. My goal here will be to read the Cyropedia, a description of the education of King Cyrus the Great. 

Regarding Christian material, I will try to read straight through the New Testament, as well as adding in portions from the Torah and the Old Testament. This part is less defined, since I feel it is going really well right now. Furthermore, the study of Christian material is more integrated into other parts of my life. 

Specific: Speak to locals while performing the same tasks as in Turkish
Read the entire New Testament
Master verb conjugations in both Modern and Ancient
Measurable: 20,000 words in Lingq, 400 hours. 
Applicable: Travelling to Greece, applicable to religion
Realistic: Yes, very achievable
Time constrained: Travel to Greece in March, Cyropedia by end of April


## Conclusion 

Perhaps these goals could be even SMARTer or more streamlined. However, I have many things that I am trying to accomplish this year. The combination of Greek and Turkish is going to be a lot in combination with some of my other ambitions this year. So for now, the only language learning goals that I am going to mark as public and place on the calendar are the ones above.
