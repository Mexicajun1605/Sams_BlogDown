# DISCLAIMER 
Please speak to a priest before taking anything that I write here as gospel. I am a sinner who is confessing their sins here in the hopes that I may learn and repent. Please learn from this as you will, but ONLY via the guidance of the Holy Spirit, the Father, and the Son. 
I do not believe that the particulars of my despair are worth sharing on the internet, but nonetheless, I confess.

# Despair is a sin 

I was actually wondering whether or not I should write this post or not, since it is more personal than most, but since the world at large also fights against this sin and the confession of sins is good for the soul, I think it will be worth it. 

```
1 John 1:9 
If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness. 
``` 

I recently had a tough conversation with someone that I love deeply and realized that I struggle deeply with despair. My despair often leads me to blame others for my own problems, refuse to partake in the joy that Christ offers me, extend this despair and frustration to others, and to place myself as an idol before God. This personally makes me think that in at least my own case, despair is a form of pride and therefore a deadly sin. I will be reflecting on each of the above mentioned. 

## Despair as a form of pride and self-idolatry 
I think that it is important to nail what exactly despair is. In Spanish, despair is translated as "desesperar" and composed of the root word "esperar," hope, and the prefix "des," lack of. The Spanish is derived from the Latin "desperare," meaning the same thing. 

Immediately, it is obvious that despair is a direct rejection of one of the greatest gifts that God has given us. 

```
1 Corinthians 13:13
And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love. 
``` 

If I deny the hope of God, then I must be relying on the reason of myself. Is not the denial of God's gifts denial of God Himself? And if I do deny God then who do I choose? In the case of despair, I believe that it is choosing to put the frustration and sorrow of myself as an individual as something more valuable than the Grace and Peace of my Lord. 

Anything can become an idol, and surely the adversary could find it easy to tempt people of all personality types, especially the ambitious, into succumbing to this sin. I do not blame the devil for this. Adam chose to eat of the fruit, and so have I, rather I acknowledge that I am under spiritual attack and have failed to properly prepare for my own defenses. 
I have fallen to placing myself before God. 

### What St. Thomas Aquinas has to say 

While reflecting on this, I of course searched for my problem in the internet (NOTE That this may not be advisable, I was only led to this by God's Grace). In that process, I came across something that St. Thomas Aquinas wrote in the Summa Theologica about whether despair is a sin or not. I will not copy the objections and responses to them, but will paste the answer here. 

```
- Therefore, just as the movement of hope, which is in conformity with the true opinion, is praiseworthy and virtuous, so the contrary movement of despair, which is in conformity with the false opinion about God, is vicious and sinful.
``` 

I summarize the above statement as follows. If hope is to conform to the will of God, then despair is to unconform to His will. If sin is hamartia, missing the mark that is God, then by definition despair is a sin. 

Aquinas elaborates further, 

```
-then despair is more dangerous, since hope withdraws us from evils and induces us to seek for good things, so that when hope is given up, men rush headlong into sin, and are drawn away from good works. Wherefore a gloss on Proverbs 24:10, "If thou lose hope being weary in the day of distress, thy strength shall be diminished," says: "Nothing is more hateful than despair, for the man that has it loses his constancy both in the every day toils of this life, and, what is worse, in the battle of faith." And Isidore says (De Sum. Bono ii, 14): "To commit a crime is to kill the soul, but to despair is to fall into hell."
``` 

The aforementioned causes me to reflect and remember to two things, 
1. What I understand the Saint to be saying 
2. How a demon defined Hell 

First, not only does despair lend itself to the production of more sin, but also is a sin in and of itself. 

Secondly, because of Isidore's quote, I cannot help but remember what Mephistopheles says to Faust when the latter denies Hell's existence. Marlowe, recounts how the demon rebukes Faust, for whatever reason whether compassion or warning if demons are capable of such things, and says to the professor, 

"Why this is Hell, nor am I out of it! Thinkest thou that I that saw the face of God am not in ten thousand Hells in being deprived of everlasting bliss." 

To constantly be in despair and not repent, is to choose the fate of Mephistopheles and to suffer the fate of the adversary who thought that he was greater than the Lord. 

The adversary despaired pridefully that he was now the second greatest in Heaven, and in his despair was driven to further sin and rebelled unto death. 

## Blaming others for my own problems 

I purposefully reflect on the fall of Satan because it was his despair that led to his pride that led to his rebellion. The adversary could not fathom how the Son could be greater than him and blamed his own creator instead of taking responsibility for his own actions and choosing to join the other angels in heavenly communion. 

I reflect on this as despair and choose to call it that because it was born out of the lust he felt for the pleasure of being the highest of the angels. 

Aquinas says, 

``` 
for the love of those pleasures leads man to have a distaste for spiritual things, and not to hope for them as arduous goods. On this way despair is caused by lust.
``` 

Just because my despair is born of the desire to do great things, does not mean that I can blame others when things do not go the way that I expect them to. 

## How despair is born out of my lust for the pleasure of success 

It is far too easy for me to state how this sin has affected me and how I have let it affect me in my own life. I am an ambitious individual and I want to become better. However, since this sin is deadly, I have let it convince me that my time is more important than that of others, that I and my value are equivalent to these earthly accomplishments and studies that I strive after, and that I blame the ones I love around me when I inevitably fail to accomplish these goals. 

Ambitions and goals are goods in and of themselves surely. However, it is the constant pursuit of these things above love for God and others that drags me down into lacking faith for myself and losing hope for the future and in so doing, failing to love. 

My sin of despair is born out of my lust for intelligence, career, success, renown, etc. All great things, but all meaningless without God's love. 

## The physical aspect, chemicals in the brain 

Even though I have been diagnosed with Depression, and am prone to this sin on a physical level, this does not justify it. Rather it is my responsibility to practice to hone and heal this part of my soul than to allow a chemical imbalance in my brain to dictate my actions. 

If someone is prone to gluttony and becomes fat, it is wrong for us to simply allow them to be under the delusion that just because they are born with a disposition to overconsumption of food that all is well. That is wrong. Rather we encourage this person to get up and exercise and do what is well and good for the body and to conquor this sin. 

The same can be said for despair and its ties to depression. It is the responsibility of the depressed person to fight this disease in spite of the difficulties they face, to stand up and rejoice in the joy of the life of Christ. 

In being redeemed, I become a son of God. I am not defined by a disease. 

1 John 3:1 
```
See what great love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God! 
``` 

# Conclusion 

Reader, I ask that you will pray for me that I will, by the power of God's grace, overcome this sin. 

I pray that I may keep the commands of the Lord, and in so doing shine His light and love. I can be the most intelligent, strong, athletic, erudite, etc, but if I do not keep the greatest of the Lord's commands, which is to love and to be Him, then I am nothing. St. Paul writes, 

1 Corinthians 13:1-3
``` 
If I speak in the tongues of men or of angels, but do not have love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal. If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. If I give all I possess to the poor and give over my body to hardship that I may boast,[b] but do not have love, I gain nothing.
```  

Perhaps another opposite of despair is Joy. I pray that I might be joyful just as Christ commanded and reflect this joy to those that I am in contact with. 

John 15:10-12 
```
If you keep my commands, you will remain in my love, just as I have kept my Fatherâ€™s commands and remain in his love. I have told you this so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete. My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you.
``` 

If I have wronged you in despair, I ask your forgiveness. I ask the forgiveness of God as well. 

## The Jesus Prayer
Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me a Sinner. 

May the Lord bless you
